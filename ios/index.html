																</h1>
																<p>A week ago, I wanted to speak at a local meetup called She ‚Äôn IT about my way into IT, but I had to cancel last minute because I was sick. ü§ß I will get another chance to talk about it in the future, but because I really love hearing other people‚Äôs stories, especially other stories from women in tech, I decided to write my story down in form of a blog post.</p>

																</h1>
																<p>Typos in code can always happen, we‚Äôre all human. Most of us aren‚Äôt native speakers and write their code in English anyway. But typos in code can be annoying. Other developers will eventually stumble across them and can get distracted reading the code. At best, they will fix the typo, but it will be bit of work to make the change, commit the code etc. It would be better not to introduce typos in the first place, right? Someone should be alerting us to typos as we write the code! Well, Xcode can actually do that!</p>

																		<a href="/posts/summaries-ios-interview-topics">Sketchnote Summaries of possible iOS Interview Topics</a>
																</h1>
																<p>After my first technical interviews in years, I have found that it's always a good idea to refresh your knowledge and prepare for technical interview questions (who would've thought) üòÖ Although I knew what the questions were about, I found it difficult to talk about details and explain topics spontaneously. To be less freaked out when an interviewer asks me about capture lists or memory management in Swift, I wanted to make some sketchnotes on possible interview topics. They would be perfect as a summary. And if they help me, maybe they'll help you too.</p>

																		<a href="/posts/basic-ipad-support">How I Added Basic iPad Support to my iPhone Only App</a>
																</h1>
																<p>I have a confession to make. It's really sad, but true. In my career as an iOS developer, I've only ever build iPhone apps. iPads were never meant to be supported. Well... the apps "worked" in theory! Sort of. So, during my vacation in December, it was finally time to start working on the two-plus years old ticket to add iPad and iPhone landscape support for Cineaste App.</p>

																<p>The last days, I migrated some of my open source repositories from Travis CI to GitHub Actions. I only used Travis for running tests or linter, nothing too complicated.</p>

																		<a href="/posts/building-apps-for-everyone">Building Apps for Everyone?!</a>
																</h1>
																<p>Is it really important to build mobile apps with accessibility features and who needs them? Deep down, everyone of us knows that when we don‚Äôt support accessibility features in our products, we leave users behind. But in reality, we all find tons of excuses for not going that extra mile ‚Ä¶</p>
