</figure><h2 id=	"why-sketchnoting-matters-✨">Why Sketchnoting Matters ✨</h2><p>Sketchnoting combines creativity and focused listening by using handwritten notes, sketches, typography, and symbols. And here’s the best part: you don’t need any special drawing skills to get started.</p><p>Sketchnoting helps developers to:</p><ul><li><strong>Capture important ideas</strong>: Sketchnotes summarize each session into a memorable and shareable format.</li><li><strong>Stay focused</strong>: It’s easy to get distracted, but when you’re taking notes as you listen, you stay engaged and it helps you get the most out of each talk.</li><li><strong>Boost engagement</strong>: Visual summaries of technical content are not only more interesting but also easier to recall later on.</li></ul><p>Over time, I’ve shared my sketchnotes through social media and my website, and they’ve resonated with many in the developer community. These visual notes don’t just help others revisit key ideas; they also encourage more people to explore the power of visual communication.</p><h2 id=	"my-vision-for-ios-conferences">My Vision for iOS Conferences</h2><p>I’d love to bring sketchnoting workshops to iOS conferences this year. By hosting 1,5 hour workshops, participants can:</p><ul><li>Learn the basics of sketchnoting – no prior drawing skills needed.</li><li>Practice creating sketchnotes during the following conference talks.</li><li>Get creative and have fun.</li></ul><p>Imagine a conference hall filled with developers who walk away not just with new ideas, but also with vibrant, visually crafted notes they can revisit or share with colleagues. That’s the kind of experience I want to create.</p><h2 id=	"📣-calling-all-sketchnoting-enthusiasts-📣">📣 Calling All Sketchnoting Enthusiasts 📣</h2><p>Are you new to sketchnoting or simply curious? Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, I’d love to see you in one of my workshops! <strong>If you’d like to learn this skill at your favorite conference, let me and the organizers know.</strong></p><p>Sketchnoting can also help if you’re speaking at a conference. Summarizing your talk in a sketchnote is a great way to ensure you’ve covered your key points and it provides attendees with a handy visual takeaway.</p><h2 id=	"for-conference-organizers">For Conference Organizers</h2><p>Curious about hosting a sketchnoting workshop at your conference?</p><p>Here’s what makes it successful:</p><ul><li><strong>Timing:</strong> Schedule the sketchnoting workshop a day before the conference talks begin. A workshop would take 1 to 1,5 hours. This way, attendees can practice their new skills directly during the conference.</li><li><strong>Free access:</strong> Many attendees arrive a day early, so a free workshop like this is a great way for them to connect and get prepped for the main event.</li><li><strong>Setup:</strong> For both in-person and remote settings, I need a room (or virtual space) with a monitor to display an overhead view of my drawing process and participants have a desk to take notes.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Provide some supplies like pencils, a colorful brush pen (I can help with the selection), and blank paper or a notebook from a sponsor.</li></ul><p>Since I’m a full-time iOS developer and don’t earn money from sketchnoting, I’d appreciate support with travel and accommodation. I’m based in Germany and prefer eco-friendly train travel within Europe. I’m also open to one trip outside Europe this year to help train new sketchnoters. I’m only interested in Apple-related conferences so I can also enjoy the talks and learn from them.</p><h2 id=	"let’s-build-a-creative-community-together-🙌">Let’s Build a Creative Community Together 🙌</h2><p>As we kick off 2025, I’m excited about sharing sketchnoting with the iOS community.

Imagine trying to use an app where you can’t read the text, interact with buttons, or navigate at all. Sounds unnecessarily frustrating, right? That’s still sadly the reality for many people who are dependent on assistive technologies in their life. But as developers, we have the power to ensure our apps are accessible and usable for everyone.</p><p>But let’s be real—spotting accessibility issues can feel tricky and overwhelming. That’s where the <strong><a href="https://revealapp.com/#accessibility">Reveal app</a> by Itty Bitty Apps</strong> comes to the rescue! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️ It’s my secret weapon for uncovering accessibility bugs that can slip through the cracks.</p><p>In this post, I’ll share how Reveal makes my life easier by helping to test and identify accessibility issues in iOS apps. It’s like having X-ray vision for your app’s UI! Let’s dive in and see how the tool can help you make your apps better for everyone. 🚀</p><h2 id=	"setting-up-reveal-app-locally">Setting up Reveal App Locally</h2><ol><li>Download <a href="https://revealapp.com/free-trial/">Reveal</a> – there’s a 14-day free trial option</li><li><a href="https://support.revealapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022818251-Integrating-Reveal-with-your-iOS-application">Link Reveal with Xcode</a></li><li>Run the app</li><li>Navigate to the feature in the simulator</li><li>Open Reveal and select the app that you want to inspect</li></ol><h2 id=	"unveiling-the-magic-of-reveal-app">Unveiling the Magic of Reveal App</h2><p>Alright, let’s get into the good stuff. ✨ Here are some of the features of Reveal:</p><h3 id=	"1.-insights-workspace">1. Insights Workspace</h3><p>The insights workspace is a <a href="https://revealapp.com/news/introducing-insights-and-new-pricing/#introducing-insights">recent addition to Reveal</a> (added October 2023). You can audit your app for best practices and guidelines with more than 130 rules that pinpoint areas of improvement. The rules include the following categories:</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">Human Interface Guidelines</a></li><li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG 2.2</a> A, AA and AAA – Web Content Accessibility Guidelines how to make the digital world more accessible. As example, one of the criteria is that <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color">colors should not be used as the only way to convey content or distinguish visual elements</a>. There’s a <a href="https://guia-wcag.com/en/">quick reference guide</a> for an easier overview of the criteria.</li><li>Accessibility Best Practices</li><li>UIKit Best Practices, like broken constraints</li><li>Color Contrast</li></ul><p>The results will be sorted by passed, skipped, message, warning, or failed. Each rule has additional documentation and links to references, so you get enough context on how to act on the finding.</p><h4 id=	"when-to-use-it?">When to use it?</h4><p>The insights workspace is especially helpful when you feel lost and don’t know where to start. Focus on the issues that have failed during the audit. But also remember “progress over perfection”, any improvement is better than no improvement at all.</p><figure>

In the middle, there are more details and links to documentation. On the right side, the part of the screen is highlighted that is affected by the issue." />

</figure><h3 id=	"2.-accessibility-workspace">2. Accessibility Workspace</h3><p>One of my favorite and most often used features is the accessibility workspace. It allows you to view accessibility properties in a nice visual interface together with your feature. You can check if all your UI elements have appropriate labels, traits, and hints and are configured as expected. Plus, you can see how VoiceOver or Voice Control will interact with your app (there’s a dropdown in the top area), making it a breeze to fix any issues. It even supports newer APIs like AXCustomContent, which is not supported in Xcode’s accessibility inspector.</p><figure>

In the middle, the app screen is shown with rectangles for each accessibility element. On the right side, there are more accessibility properties for the selected element." />
    <figcaption>Accessibility workspace in Reveal app showing the movie detail page for VoiceOver.</figcaption>
</figure><h4 id=	"when-to-use-it?">When to use it?</h4><p>I usually use it during development or when I fix accessibility bugs. Here are some of the criteria that I check:</p><ul><li>VoiceOver: Do all elements have a rectangle (meaning are they accessible to VoiceOver) or is an element missing?</li><li>Voice Control: Do only interactive elements have a rectangle and a number? This is important to reduce clutter.</li><li>Does the order of the elements make sense? Does it follow the visual order where possible?</li><li>In the left column, are there elements with missing context e.g. “Button” only?</li><li>In the left column, are there cryptic names, e.g. file names instead of semantic names?</li><li>Are buttons marked as buttons?</li><li>Are headings marked as headings?</li></ul><p>⚠️ Note: Verify your features in Reveal during development or to find issues more quickly, but always test at least once on a real device with enabled assistive technology. There can be a mismatch between the generated view in Reveal and the real experience.</p><h3 id=	"3.-layout-workspace">3. Layout Workspace</h3><p>Reveal lets you see the entire view hierarchy of your app in real-time. You can inspect every element, check how they are nested, and ensure they are logically arranged. This makes it easier to spot layout issues, and debug the view hierarchy. This feature is similar to Xcode’s view hierarchy debugger, but with better support for SwiftUI views.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/2024-05-16-accessibility-uncovered-with-reveal/layout-workspace.png" alt="Screenshot of Reveal app. On the left side, there’s a list of view layers in the app hierarchy. In the middle, there’s a 3D view of the view layers and how they make up the view hierarchy. On the right side, more information to the selected element is shown like the frame size." />

</figure><h3 id=	"wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3><p>The Reveal app has been a game-changer for me, helping me build more accessible iOS apps with ease and confidence. As we celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, let’s commit to making our apps better for everyone. With tools like Reveal, creating inclusive experiences is not just possible but also incredibly rewarding.</p><p>So, give Reveal a try, and let’s make our apps accessible to all! 🌍✨</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/2024-02-04-thoughts-about-2023</guid><title>Thoughts about 2023</title><description>It’s February 4th, 2024, and it took me multiple weeks to write this post... 🙈 In 2023, I didn’t share my thoughts on 2022 because I was sick and felt extremly tired at the end of the year.

A few months later, I regretted not taking the time to reflect. At the end of 2023, I was sick again (like every 5th person in Germany), and I felt unmotivated for various reasons. But a bit delayed, I’ll share my thoughts about 2023 now!</p><p>In 2023...</p><ul><li><strong>I traveled through six countries in Europe by train and bus, in total around 8.000 km.</strong> In comparison to that, I took one flight to Stockholm and back (~3.000 km) and one from Bilbao to Munich (~1.600 km) after Flixbus decided to leave without me in the middle of the night in Spain. 🚆</li><li><strong>I climbed 180 routes</strong> which sums up to around 2 km in height and 42 hours in total. I also did my first multi-pitch route together with my sister. 🧗</li><li><strong>I gave my <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/2023-04-18-mixit-talk/">very first conference talk with 500 people in the audience</a></strong> and the talk was live streamed and recorded. 🎤</li><li><strong>I let my hair grow again.</strong> It’s now shoulder length. 💇‍♀️</li></ul><h2 id="travel">Travelling by train</h2><p>Looking through my photographs, I realized I traveled a lot by train and bus, and <strong>I both loved it and was challenged by it</strong>.</p><p>I traveled to various places in Europe, including:</p><ul><li>April: Lyon, France – by train and night bus to MiXiT conference for my first keynote talk 🇫🇷</li><li>May: Stockholm, Sweden – by plane for Spotify Intro Days 🇸🇪</li><li>September: Barcelona &amp; Logroño &amp; Bilbao, Spain – by train, bus and <s>night bus</s> plane for NSSpain conference 🇪🇸</li><li>October: Linz, Austria – by train for a Yoga retreat 🇦🇹</li><li>December: Amsterdam, Netherlands – by train for vacation 🇳🇱</li></ul><p>I loved how traveling by train or bus made me more aware of the distance, forcing me to slow down. It’s better for the environment and allows me to enjoy the changing landscape through the window.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/2024-02-04-thoughts-about-2023/travel.jpg" alt="Collage of six pictures. 1: train station in Nuremberg, it’s still dark and a train is waiting at the station.

    <figcaption>Feli on her way to somewhere...</figcaption>
</figure><p>One downside of train travel is the high cost of tickets. I can’t understand why train travel is more expensive than flights. It should be the other way around for many reasons...</p><p>Most of the time, I traveled alone. I learned a lot about my boundaries, how much stress, changes in plans and uncertainty I can bare and which decisions I want to take and which I don’t. Being a picky eater, navigating foreign menus without understanding the language was a challenge. But I wasn’t starving during my trips, it just took me a lot of energy, especially since I get easily “hangry”. 🤣</p><p>At the end of my trip to Spain, I found myself stranded in the middle of the night at a bus station because Flixbus left ealier than planned without notifying me. So I was not speaking the language, unfamiliar with the culture, and uncertain about whether it’s safe as a woman alone at night. I just wanted to be finally home again. I was so glad I could call my partner and he would patiently listen to me both crying and complaining, and in the end organize a hotel and an alternative way back home.</p><p>In conclusion, most of the times <strong>I really enjoyed long-distance travel in Europe by train and bus and will definitely do it again</strong>! Looking forward what 2024 adds to the list of train travels (like the <a href="https://www.vr.fi/en/santa-claus-express">Santa Claus Express</a> in Finland soon 👀).</p><h2 id="work">Work work work</h2><p>I feel like 2023 was the year in which I learned the most about accessibility in different contexts! The more I learned about best practices and strategies, the more I felt like I don’t know much at all. 😄</p><p>The year started with having the possibility to embed in the accessibility team at Spotify! Wow! It was an honor to work with such talented and passionate people. I was very excited about this opportunity but also felt a heavy responsibility on my shoulders. I learned tons about accessibility best practices and the importance of progress over perfection. If you feel lost about where to begin, start with one improvement — it’s one step closer to your goal.</p><p>In May, I traveled to Stockholm for my Intro Days! It felt a bit weird, because I joined the company in mid 2021, but because of the pandemic we had a virtual format and they made up for that last year. It was amazing to meet colleagues in person, speak to people from different parts of the company, and it was an exciting and inspiring experience.</p><iframe src="https://iosdev.space/@feli/110440328349456941/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="550" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://iosdev.space/embed.js" async="async"></script><p>In the summer, I embedded with a design system team and was faced with different challenges. This time, I wanted to figure out how to make generic layout components as accessible as possible. These components should be used by a lot of developers to build their features. Should these components have accessibility support out of the box? Should developers have to even think about accessibility? What happens if they forget to think about it? How can we get the best experience for the user? How can we increase the knowledge of developers who are using the generic components to level up the accessibility support even more? I honestly feel like I haven’t <em>thought</em> that much for a long time. 🤯 I was going for walks a lot just to sort my thoughts. Most days I tried out different solutions, got feedback from others and started over again because I forgot an important aspect. I’m pleased with the outcome and I even gave a talk (with live demo) about this topic in an internal conference at Spotify. 🤩</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/2024-02-04-thoughts-about-2023/talk.jpg" alt="Feli presenting accessibility shortcuts for the iPhone. On the right a small thumbnail with Feli smiling into the camera." />
    <figcaption>Live demos are pure magic ✨</figcaption>
</figure><p>Because it was a talk about accessibility, I was pleasantly surprised to have a live audience of ~270 people with very different roles in the organization. Not sure how many people watched the recording since then, but it made my day to hear from a few people about how inspired they felt after watching the talk. So my goal to have an impact on at least one person is definitely achieved!</p><p>The rest of the year was a mix of working on other workstreams but always with a bit of accessibility work included. I love how I can have an impact this way. My newest challenge, after a chaotic December, is to find my path in a new team outside of design systems but with a bit more focus on feature development. It’s great to be challenged and to try out new things, and the learning curve is immense.</p><h2 id="social-media">Tired of social media</h2><p>I felt (and still feel) quite tired when it comes to social media. I’m confused about where to post content, if I can even think of something valuable to share.</p><p>For my sketchnotes from NSSpain conference, it was so exhausting to post on both platforms (<a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1701956107894239315">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://iosdev.space/@feli/111058207657932171">Mastodon</a>). Honestly I won’t do this again the next time...</p><p>So at this point, I only post stories on Instagram from time to time. I have a private account, but if you want to send me a follow request and we both know each other, I will approve it. I even created a new Instagram account, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/felibe444/">@felibe444</a>, where I could post my sketchnotes, but I never got over the initial barrier to actually start posting. 🫠</p><p>Twitter is not what it once was, so I seldomly check for news. I’m still not used to Mastodon and I don’t visit it very often either. I got access to Bluesky, but after I created my account, I lost motivation very quickly, so I never opened it again. It’s sad because Twitter felt like a home for my iOS bubble and friends, but life goes on, and I decided to just take it slow for now. Appreciate you all anyway. 🧡</p><h2 id="sport">Keep moving</h2><p>2023 was my year of rock climbing and running!</p><p>I started running at the end of 2022 when my motivation for swimming was lacking a bit. I started very slowly with different approaches and with the support of some apps. In the end, I stuck with Nike Run Club because I love the healthy approach in the guided workouts. They make you aware not to compare yourself with others but to focus on yourself and your own journey. They also celebrate every start of the workout (yay) and emphasize that it’s okay not to have the best run every time. It’s not about numbers; it’s about leaving the couch, moving around, and getting your heart rate up! I really started to enjoy running, which never happened to me before.</p><p>Especially during summer, I loved going for a run after work. In autumn, when it got dark sooner, I had trouble finding a good time slot for my runs. I won’t go for a run when it’s dark because the park I usually run in has no lights. When I go for a run before work, I usually have very low energy in the afternoon and feel tired the whole day. Sometimes I can make it before my lunch break, but it is a bit trickier to organize with work. So I had quite a long break of two months at the end of the year when I wasn’t running at all. Now, in February, the days are getting longer again, and I can’t wait to go for a run after work again (actually it worked out yesterday and I loved it)! It’s a great workout for me to get out of work mode and to think about something else. It also doesn’t take as long as it would when I go swimming.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Climbing in 2023 was one of my constants. Something I’m always looking forward throughout the week. I had a few very successful climbing sessions and a lot more where I was not super happy with how it went. I did my first multi-pitch climb with my sister with 70 meters of climbing! That was awesome. But once in a while I have to define what success means for every session so I’m not disappointed. Sometimes it’s enough to have fun with easier climbs and don’t try the hard ones which are on my limit. Sometimes it’s hard to convince myself to be brave again and not let the fear win.</p><p>This one entry from my journal reflects my feelings quite well:</p><blockquote>
<p>I watched a woman climb today. She was calm, focused, and made it look easy. She climbed a route I tried before – 15 meters, around two-thirds slight overhanging, followed by a roof. It was a 6 on UUID scale, so I thought I should be able to do it. Because of the overhanging part I was scared even before I started. Though most of the holds were good. I try to work on my fear of overhangs but every time I climb something like this and even if I succeed, it still feels super scary.</p>
<p>Seeing this woman climb the same route I struggled with, made me admire her skills. I couldn’t stop watching. After she finished, I told her how effortless it looked. She said she’s been climbing for over 10 years and this was just her warm-up. She climbs three times a week and worked a lot on overhangs to overcome her fear.</p>
<p>She’s put in a lot of effort over a long time to get so good. It’s important not to compare yourself to others. Focus on getting better and celebrate the small wins.</p>
<p>I gave up on the climb after two-thirds because I was too scared and tired. At first, I felt bad about it. Even though it was a level 6, I let fear stop me. But looking back, I started struggling with the climb a few meters in and managed to climb at least three more meters while scared. That’s a win. I tried, pushed myself and next time, I think I can climb even further.</p>
</blockquote><p>One special highlight was going on a climbing vacation with my sister! We spent a week in the Chiemgau in the south of Germany, we climbed on one peak of the Kampenwand and she taught me how to do multi-pitch climbing! I really enjoyed the fact that we could hike, relax, climb, go to the spa, in the perfect change to treat our sore muscles 😅</p><figure>

</figure><p>Besides being quite nervous obviously, I had a great experience on stage! I think... Because I don’t really remember anything except going on stage and leaving the stage again 😅</p><p>At the conference, I had some initial hesitance to approach other people, because I’m very introverted and everyone spoke in French and I didn’t want to force anyone to speak English with me. But I met some of the nicest people who saw me standing around by myself and who decided to talk to me and include me in their group 🧡 I did not expect something like this!</p><p>In general, I was very impressed with the inclusivity of the event. It was amazing to meet new people outside of my iOS developer bubble and I really enjoyed the events that were organized for the speakers, which helped me a lot to connect with others. Sadly there were only a few other talks in English, the rest were given in French. But from talking to other speakers, I heard that there were a lot of interesting talks about more inclusion in workplaces and about accessibility. Maybe there’s a chance to watch the recordings with English transcripts 🤞</p><p>Lyon alone is worth the trip. I really enjoyed walking around and exploring the city. There are some beautiful areas with fascinating views! After the conference, we had the opportunity to join a two-hour city tour to learn more about the history of Lyon.</p><p>Thank you to all MiXiT organizers and participants for making this a lovely experience!</p><figure>

How to Write Image Descriptions for Sketchnotes That are Actually Useful</h2><p>You should add image descriptions to images that you share online. Image descriptions are not only essential for screen reader users but they will also make images accessible when an image server is offline (looking at you Twitter 👀) or when you have bad internet connection. Read more about <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/write-image-descriptions">how to write image descriptions</a>.</p><p>The option to add image descriptions is available on nearly all larger platforms.</p><p>Some example apps:</p><ul><li><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/add-image-descriptions">Twitter</a>,</li><li><a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/4403914924435-Add-descriptions-to-images">Slack</a>,</li><li>different Mastodon clients</li></ul><p>Important to know for developers:</p><ul><li>in iOS apps (set the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel">accessibilityLabel</a>),</li><li>in Android apps (set the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps#describe-ui-element">contentDescription</a>)</li><li>and of course for websites (set the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_alt.asp">HTML alt attribute</a> on images).</li></ul><p>If you find a social media platform that doesn’t provide the option to add image descriptions to images, you can describe the image in the message itself as workaround. Please, report this as a bug to the developers. I find that accessibility is not a feature that can be added at a later time in the product development. If a feature is not accessible, it’s a bug that needs to be fixed as soon as possible.</p><p>As you might or might not know, I love sketchnoting. It’s a brilliant technique for me to summarize content in a fun way, that makes it easy to stay engaged during a talk and also to make it convenient to look something up at a later time.</p><h2 id=	"my-inner-struggle">My Inner Struggle</h2><p><strong>I’ve always silently struggled with the conflict</strong> of trying to make the content that I create as accessible as possible and on the other side I create these completely inaccessible sketchnotes because they’re made of images and not text. I used to add image descriptions to the sketchnotes, but the descriptions were quite short and very non-descriptive. Usually it just was something like “Sketchnote about X, Y, Z” and that’s it.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/2023-03-10-detailed-image-descriptions/twitter-alt-badge-preview.png" alt="Screenshot from a past tweet of a sketchnote from Anna. There’s a pop up open with the alt text of the sketchnote, reading: Sketchnote of iOSDevUK talk by Anna Beltrami about the power of iPad playgrounds" />
    <figcaption>On Twitter you can see whether an image provides alt text or not indicated by a small ALT badge in the lower left. You can select the badge to preview the image description, which is great for awareness.</figcaption>
</figure><p>I therefore talked to some of my colleagues in the Spotify accessibility team about my struggles with this. After listening to their input, it struck me that even though it means extra work for me and takes some time, I <em>should</em> add a more detailed image description to the sketchnotes so that everyone can access the content if they want to. <strong>I want to do better!</strong> Having a more detailed description would be valuable not only for screen reader users but for others as well. Especially because everything in the sketchnotes is handwritten, which makes it more difficult to read, and also the structure and context of the content is sometimes tricky to understand. Different ways of providing content are always the best solution anyway. This is also why you should provide subtitles for your videos and transcripts for your podcasts! But those are topics for another time.</p><h2 id=	"the-problem">The Problem</h2><p>Almost all my sketchnotes contain a lot of text with some smaller sketches and containers to group the content. The more words the sketchnotes contain, the longer the image description – obviously.</p><p>Most <strong>platforms have a limit of 1000 characters for the image description</strong>, like Twitter or Slack. But this is not enough for most of my sketchnotes. When I tried to find a solution online, I found little information on how to write alt text for very complex graphics.</p><p>For images with graphs or statistics, the recommendation is usually to summarize and interpret the main message of the content rather than describe it. That’s good to know, but how would that apply to sketchnotes? Sure, I could try to find the <em>one main statement</em> to add to the alt text, but often sketchnotes are a summary of something bigger. Is it useful to add a summary to a summary? Is that good enough? I don’t think so. A large part of the content of the sketchnotes would be left out.</p><p>Even if the platform has no character limit, imagine listening to several minutes or more of voice output describing the complete image without any pause. There is no way to skip content, jump to a specific section or pause and resume the image description. It always starts at the beginning. Wouldn’t it be nice if the image description was in a semantic structure that offered all these functions? Something like a simple HTML page?</p><h2 id=	"the-solution">The Solution</h2><p>My current approach for longer image descriptions is to <strong>publish them on an external page</strong>, e.g. in a Google document or directly on my website. The text will...</p><ul><li>be structured with several heading levels,</li><li>make use of enumerations,</li><li>and take advantage of all the other functionality to structure text.</li></ul><p>After that, I can link to the page in the social media post together with the image. It’s important to know that <strong>you should not add links to the alt text directly</strong>, because it’s not possible for screen readers to interact with the link in the image description directly. The image itself will still contain a short image description like previously.</p><p>Another advantage of having the content of the sketchnote in an accessible and written form is that you can easily search the content, which is handy for me and also quite nice for search engine optimization (SEO) reasons.</p><p>So, the last days, I’ve updated my website to support longer image descriptions for my sketchnotes and the new more detailed descriptions will be displayed underneath the sketchnote on the detail page. You can explore my first <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/sketchnotes/captions-transcripts-subtitles/">sketchnote with a more detailed image description</a> about Captions, Transcripts, Audio Descriptions, Sign Language Interpretation. Please, let me know what you think!</p><h2 id=	"my-new-workflow">My new Workflow</h2><ol><li>Create the sketchnote and export it as an image as usual.</li><li>Open the image file in the macOS Preview app or the iOS Photos app.</li><li>Use the handy function to <strong>copy and paste text from an image</strong> (I love it).</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, due to the structure of my sketchnotes, this usually ends up with the kinda right words but totally in the wrong order.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/2023-03-10-detailed-image-descriptions/workflow.png" alt="Two screenshots next to each other. The first one shows Preview app with one of my sketchnotes and the selected text from the image. There is a text reading 'Copy All' under the screenshot with an arrow to the next screenshot which is a text editor some text in it. There is a text reading 'Paste' under the screenshot." />

</figure><ol start="4"><li>Sort the text, so that it is in the right order.</li><li>Fix leftover typos from the generated text.</li><li>Add structure and semantic elements, like headings and bullet lists.</li><li>Publish the new sketchnote with the image description on my website.</li></ol><p>From now on, when I post a sketchnote on social media, I can add a link to the detailed image description on my website.</p><hr><p>Phew, that sounds like a lot of work.... And to be honest, it is. It won’t be possible for me to publish sketchnotes with the detailed image descriptions when I do sketchnotes live at conferences for example. But I can always add a link with the longer image description afterwards.</p><p>But this new approach has some nice side effects too. It will give me a chance to walk through the content another time and just by that it will make it easier for me to remember it. Additionally the approach will calm my inner anxiety, and <strong>make my sketchnotes more accessible to everyone, and that is always worth the effort.</strong> If I can do something for inclusion (and I know how to do it), I will definitely go the extra mile.</p><p>Do you have ideas on how to improve this?

If you’re in the area of Nuremberg, check out the awesome meetup, everyone is welcome 🧡</p><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: This is a personal story about my own unique experiences, my path and my personal challenges. Who would’ve thought? Every story is unique and so is every person.</p></blockquote><h2 id=	"who-am-i?">Who am I?</h2><p>I’m Feli, 29 years old and I live in Nuremberg, Germany, where I also grew up. My pronouns are she/her. I’m in IT for around seven years now. I work as an iOS developer and I especially love to focus on user experience and accessibility. I also create sketchnotes at conferences from time to time and share them in the internet. 💁‍♀️</p><p><strong>But... I actually never wanted to work in tech.</strong></p><h2 id=	"let’s-jump-back-a-few-years">Let’s jump back a few years</h2><p>After my A-levels in 2011, I was a bit clueless what I wanted to do. 🤔 I decided to do a <strong>one year training to become a camera woman</strong>, just because it was fun, I loved to be creative and wanted to learn more about creating movies. 🎥 Because finding a job in this area is really hard, I decided to study something afterwards. I did not really care what it was, but I wanted to do <em>something with media</em>. I finally decided to sign up for <strong>Media Engineering</strong> which was designed to be a mix between design, computer science and engineering. So I learned a bit of everything but nothing really well.</p><p>After my <strong>internship as a designer</strong> in the 4th semester, it was clear to me, that design was nothing that I am really good in. 👩‍🎨 My job was mostly to make some data beautiful for presentations and I had no idea how to do that. I’m really good in evaluating designs and thinking about what is working good and what not, but <strong>I just couldn’t come up with a design on my own</strong>.</p><h2 id=	"so,-what-now?">So, what now?</h2><p>At one point in my studies, we had to work on a project together with other students and my group decided to create an iOS app which I really enjoyed 📱 Swift was released just a year ago and we heard that it should be super easy to learn it. Nobody of us had a clue how to develop iOS apps but we figured it out and it kinda worked in the end. <strong>I wanted to do more like this!</strong> That was fun!</p><p>I decided to look for a working student job in the area of <strong>mobile development</strong>. Why mobile development, you might ask? Well, almost everyone has a smartphone these days and I loved the direct feedback to work with UI and to use it on my phone. You can use mobile apps everywhere and not just on your local computer at home. This was really fascinating to me!</p><p>In 2015, <strong>I got a job as iOS developer</strong> at adorsys and learned how to develop iOS apps the right way. 👩‍💻 I wondered for a long time why they hired me because <strong>I didn’t know anything about iOS development really</strong>. Today I know better. It’s more important how motivated you are and how good you can learn new things, than what you actually know at that time.</p><h2 id=	"is-this-the-right-place-for-me?">Is this the right place for me?</h2><p>The job was fun, I learned a LOT, but I was often asking myself if it would’ve been better if I had studied computer science. I always felt behind everyone else in terms of knowledge and there were so many things I had never heard of before. 😟 I was the only female engineer (or one of very few) in my team most of the time I was working there. Don’t get me wrong, many of my colleagues are still really good friends even years later. But especially during lunch breaks when they discussed the latest tech trends and argued about tabs vs. spaces, I felt like I was not “nerdy” enough and that I don’t really belong here, because I wasn’t interested in the same topics as everyone else.</p><p>I did not grow up with building my own websites or playing around with computers. I mean, we had a computer at home but I only used it to watch my older sister while she played games and later I used it to chat with friends but that’s it. I don’t know how a computer worked (and I still don’t know 😅) and that I could do more with it. I had no contact points with IT at all during my childhood. In school I was surprisingly good in computer science but I had no interest in it. At one point, there was literally no other girl in the class anymore that I felt so uncomfortable and decided to take the French class instead because I could be with my best friend. I was really bad in French and almost had to repeat the year because of my bad grades. But now back to 2016...</p><p>From time to time there were hackathons organized by colleagues and I always participated because I wanted to learn more and more. I was constantly trying to catch up with everyone else. But these events were often more than enough for me and I was not further interested in learning how to program roboters or how this new framework works. This made me question myself, why can I not be like everyone else here?</p><p>I always prefered to work with something visual instead of typing commands into the terminal window. Does this make me a bad developer?</p><p><strong>There were so many situations where I had to fight my imposter syndrome.</strong></p><p>It took me over a year to slowly realize that I don’t have to talk about tech during my lunch breaks. I started to get more confident and I noticed that <strong>I shouldn’t change and try to fit in</strong>. And this actually worked quite well for me and I found my niche where I can focus on user experience and accessibility. I also found the right colleagues that talked about (at least for me) more fun stuff during lunch breaks. 😅</p><p>A few years later, I was ready for a change and quit my job. After a break, I decided to reach for the stars. If it scares you, you should go for it, right? It’s about finding the balance between new challenges and feeling comfortable in what you’re doing. After some time, it surprisingly worked out and I signed a contract with Spotify in early 2021 where I now work on one of the design systems. This work is focussed on building UI that is accessible and easy to use and also contains a lot of support work where I help other developers which is super fun to me.</p><h2 id=	"today-i-know...">Today I know...</h2><ul><li>I am exactly right here in tech, even though I still struggle from time to time.</li><li>I love working on UI and helping other developers.</li><li>I don’t need to be a hardcore developer working on some low level code or be super interested in the latest tech trends to do a good job.</li><li>I enjoy advocating for more accessibility in apps and I love it when I can have an influence on others so that apps are usable for everyone in the end.</li><li>I should never change and try to fit in.

    <figcaption>My 2021 in pictures.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Can’t believe another year is over. I want it to be a tradition to reflect about the last year. I wrote down my thoughts about <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/thoughts-about-2019/">2019</a> and <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/thoughts-about-2020/">2020</a> and it helped me to remind me of my challenges, learnings and what I enjoyed the most.</p><p>2021 was definitely a year with lots of ups and downs for me!</p><p>Jump to specific topics:</p><ul><li><a href="#quit-job">I quit my very first job and now... what?</a></li><li><a href="#ios-chats">Participate in iOS Chats</a></li><li><a href="#cool-kids">How to be one of the cool kids</a></li><li><a href="#remote-conferences">More remote conferences</a></li><li><a href="#viral-tweet">First viral tweet???</a></li><li><a href="#mental-health">Let’s talk about mental health</a></li><li><a href="#sketchnotes">Gimme more sketchnotes</a></li><li><a href="#working-from-home">Still working from home</a></li><li><a href="#sport">I love sport</a></li><li><a href="#commit-history">Annual commit history</a></li></ul><h2 id="quit-job">I quit my very first job and now... what?</h2><p>The year definitely started with a low for me. I couldn’t focus and was restless, driveless and emotional very quickly. I’ve quit my very first job with lots of emotions inside me. I’ve read somewhere that you’re more attached to your first job than others. I can say it wasn’t an easy decision but I needed a change. So, without having an alternative in sight, I quit my job.</p><p>I needed time to get some distance and to be able to think clearly again. "What’s next?" was a question I was asking myself a lot. Should I continue developing iOS apps or try out something totally different? Maybe working as harvester? Selling ice cream? Doing some volunteer work? Helping others? <strong>Working on something that really matters?</strong> I tried to find something like that half-hearted, but nothing worked out. Perhaps because I didn’t really try hard enough.</p><p>But there was a way to combine my experience with something that really matters to me: <strong>developing apps with accessibility in mind.</strong> So at some point, I started to apply for iOS developer positions again.</p><p>Developing iOS apps is what I learned, what I’m experienced in and what brings me joy (normally) but I learned that <strong>I need the focus on accessibility</strong>. So I tested the accessibility on apps before I applied to the job. So many apps don’t even have basic accessibility support for Dynamic Type or Voice Over. You would get most of the features for free when you would use standard UI elements. But of course (😒) that’s not what most companys do. They want their own UI elements... and forget implementing accessibility features on top of the elements. When I talked about that in some interviews, I heard a lot of excuses. But when I look back, I’m glad that it didn’t work out. I’m tired of trying to change peoples mindsets. If they don’t know about accessibility in 2021, they possibly just don’t want to know about it. It seems like they don’t care. So I don’t care about working for them. I know that now.</p><p>What surprised me is that most companies prioritize to find out <strong>how you write code</strong> over how much you know about things that would help actual users to use their app. The kind of questions they ask are mostly about design patterns and architecture, which is fine when you’re interviewing for a non junior position, but in most interviews I wasn’t asked <strong>any questions</strong> about how I would build accessible apps.</p><p>You get asked about a lot of different topics in interviews which you don’t have to explain every day, so I sat down and re-learned some iOS basics. I created a few "easy to look up" sketchnotes about possible iOS interview topics. See the <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1371471736382832641?s=20">twitter thread</a> or the <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/summaries-ios-interview-topics/">blog post with more details</a> about it. For one of my interviews I also did refreshers on algorithms, data structures, system design and behavioral interviews, but they’re not on my website (yet). Would someone be interested in these?</p><figure>

</figure><p>At some point I was yolo enough to just send out applications even though I didn’t even think the company will ever reach out to me. But the opposite happened and I went through all interviews at Spotify successfully to my surprise. Well, kinda. But in the end, I got a job offer and finally accepted. 🥳</p><p>My biggest reasons for joining Spotify were:</p><ul><li>I’m a big fan of the Spotify app and use it every day myself</li><li>they care deeply about topics like accessibility and inclusion</li><li>the role is perfect for me: I’m working on the design system - very UI focused - to make it easy for others to build accessible UI components</li><li>many intelligent and amazing people work there, so I can learn a lot from them</li></ul><h2 id="ios-chats">Participate in iOS Chats</h2><p>I did my very first interview about how I started with iOS development and more! <a href="https://twitter.com/nemecek_f">Filip Němeček</a> interviewed me for <strong><a href="https://nemecek.be/chats/">iOS Chats</a></strong> in March! It was super fun and you can read about it here:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@felibe444</a> about getting into <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOSDev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iOSDev</a>, working on open source projects, about her wonderful sketchnotes ✏️ and more <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOSChat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iOSChat</a> 💬<a href="https://t.co/HClZ8IIA2Q">https://t.co/HClZ8IIA2Q</a></p>&mdash; Filip Nemecek (@nemecek_f) <a href="https://twitter.com/nemecek_f/status/1377312343479230466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2 id="cool-kids">How to be one of the cool kids</h2><p>End of March, I got my first longboard and started to learn how to ride it. This is one of the things which looks super easy when you watch a pro, but you need to stand on a board once to understand that you need a lot of time, practice and passion to get so good that it looks easy. It’s even a bit scary in the beginning... but it’s also super fun!

I usually tried the tricks on grass first to build up some confidence (and trick my brain) before I tried them on the street.</p><p>Looking forward to good weather to continue my journey on the board.</p><h2 id="remote-conferences">More remote conferences</h2><p>I enjoy being on conferences, even remote ones! When I saw the speaker line up, I immediately knew, that I don’t want to miss SwiftHeroes in April 2021.

It makes all the effort of doing live sketchnotes on conferences or keynotes even more worth. <strong>Thank you for your support</strong> 🙏</p><h2 id="mental-health">Let’s talk about mental health</h2><p>In August, I shared some of my routines which help me to take care of my mental health. Read <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/2021-08-22-well-being/">about my routines and about how it’s really going</a>.</p><p>For me the most important things are:</p><ul><li>Get enough sleep</li><li>Set boundaries</li><li>Move every day</li><li>Meditate and be mindful</li></ul><p>But, of course, only knowing about what helps your mental health isn’t enough, you also have to do these things. Obviously. That was my personal project the whole year (and it will also be in the future) and I’m improving a lot, but also get reminded quite quickly how important it is for me, if I let it slip for some days or even weeks.</p><p>I’m very glad that Spotify has a mental health initiative called <a href="https://lifeatspotify.com/diversity-equity-impact/mental-health">Heart &amp; Soul</a> to "raise awareness and remove stigma, provide proactive self-care and professional support, and normalize the conversation surrounding mental health". They provide a lot of materials to inform about the impact of mental health. All employees had a <a href="https://hrblog.spotify.com/2021/11/01/spotify-wellness-week/">Wellness week</a> in November for exactly this reason and the <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-10-07/spotify-encourages-everyone-to-take-a-beat-on-world-mental-health-day-and-everyday/">World Mental Health Day</a> was celebrated internally with virtual talks, workshops, and panels related to mental well-being. All employees were encouraged to participate and not "work on their normal tasks" this day.</p><p>These initiatives help me to think about my mental health more often. It’s not a taboo topic, it’s present in our daily lives and that’s one thing I really love about Spotify.</p><p><strong>It’s okay to not be okay.</strong></p><h2 id="sketchnotes">Gimme more sketchnotes</h2><p>In November, I did my first sketchnoting workshop at Spotify in a smaller setting with my squad and our sister squad. It was the first workshop in 2021 and around one year after my workshop at NSSpain 2020!</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sketchnoting?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sketchnoting</a> week for me and I already enjoy it so much! <br>🥳 Yesterday I gave a workshop for the first time in a year and it was awesome 😍<br>🍷And the next two days I’m gonna watch some amazing talks at <a href="https://twitter.com/NSSpain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NSSpain</a> and (of course) post my sketchnotes here 😉 Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/isZlWUqleL">pic.twitter.com/isZlWUqleL</a></p>&mdash; Feli #DieHimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1461020594259038220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>The workshop was of course remote for everyone and in English! <strong>It was a huge success and it was so much fun!</strong> The best thing after a workshop is to see people continue using their newly learned technique and even people who were really sceptical about this beforehand, changed their minds and were totally focussed in the workshop and loved it. 🥰</p><p>In the same week, it was NSSpain 2021 as well! Yay! You can see my NSSpain sketchnotes <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1461271436425891842?s=20">on twitter</a> or <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/nsspain21/">on my website</a>. This time I was a bit more confident than last year to talk to others in English, because it’s my new normal now at work. But it still costs me a great deal of effort to talk to others, so I’m super proud that I did it. I’m happy that I got to meet a lot of new people 👋</p><p>The most surprising thing happened after I joined a table to talk to others, I was asked if I was "the same Feli who creates the sketchnotes" and that they had only three tabs in their browser: one for the conference platform, one for the agenda and my Twitter thread with the sketchnotes 😆 I never thought something like this would ever happen! But definitely the best feeling! Thank you for sharing that with me! It made my day and I still smile when I think about it.</p><h2 id="working-from-home">Still working from home</h2><p>Since the pandemic started in March 2020, I’m working from home. Since I started at Spotify, I’m even working from home officially. So even if there were offices in my area and they would open, I could stay at home. It changed from a situational and temporary setup to a long term setup.</p><p>After nearly two years now, I can definitely say, I don’t like the lonely lunch breaks. So, if it’s safe to do so, I really enjoy meeting friends during the lunch break! I’ll definitely try to do that more often in 2022. If anyone wants to be my lunch buddy and is in my area, write me a message haha 😆</p><p>I’m also really looking forward to meet the folks from my new team in real person some day (maybe in 2022 🤞). I have never met them in real life before!</p><p>In general, I still like working from home! Since it’s now long term setup, I made my <strong>work station as ergonomic as possible</strong>, so I got a height adjustable desk, a new chair, a pillow to put my feet on (it’s so comfy), a new ergonomic mouse and a 4K monitor. Yes, that’s a lot, but I can already feel how good it is for my back and also for how I feel when I work on my desk. I just love it there, so I’m having a lot of positive emotions when working, just because it’s comfy and highly adjustable. Can only recommend to invest in that.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">...and it&#39;s finally coming together quite nicely! Don&#39;t you think? <a href="https://t.co/xGvC7hvFbo">pic.twitter.com/xGvC7hvFbo</a></p>&mdash; Feli #DieHimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1460299090777059339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>It’s the most exciting thing to <strong>talk to others from different countries with just a button tap</strong>. During my virtual Intro Days at Spotify, I talked to people from New Delhi, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Paris and Tokyo. This still blows my mind how easy it is and I love it!</p><p>That <strong>everything is now in English</strong> was something I was a bit scared of in the beginning. I was constantly using a translator to double check if my messages were correct and I forgot the translation for a lot of words in live conversations. I was just not used to use my English skills. But this is now different after six months. Of course, practice is the key and I’m now more in the "I don’t care if it’s correct" mood because most of the people are non native speakers as well and they have the same issues sometimes. Usually you’ll understand each other even if it’s not 100% gramatically correct. So, I feel more light-hearted about this topic now. It already happened a LOT of times that I think in English or I don’t remember the German word for something or I’m randomly asking others what this German word would be in English, because I was just thinking about it. 😅 By the way, if you’re a non native speaker and have trouble in pair programming sessions to name signs like these <code>()[]{},.:*</code> correctly, here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1382611757462605824?s=20">service tweet</a> for you. I constantly forget how you call these. But I guess in a year this won’t be an issues anymore, at all.</p><h2 id="sport">I love sport</h2><p>I started to go rock climbing in 2020 and I still enjoy it a lot. Being in the nature with my sister, her husband and other lovely people is the best thing I can imagine for a perfect weekend.</p><p><strong>Rock climbing is not only about muscles and technique, but also about mental strength and trust in your abilities.</strong> Most of the time I’m not very brave when I’m at a difficult part of the route and I fear to fall in the rope. I need others to cheer me on to at least try it, to actually try it. Sometimes this helps and I’m succeeding but sometimes I just give up without trying at all. It’s fine as well, because climbing for me is about having fun and I will definitely come back and try it again the next time. Overcoming my fears is something I will continue to work on in 2022, because fear shouldn’t stop me, that’s why I have the rope and someone I trust as my belayer.</p><p>I’m grateful to spend so much time with my sister doing something we both enjoy a lot. ❤️</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On top of the world with my sister ☀️🍂 <a href="https://t.co/8cR0q6MEAQ">pic.twitter.com/8cR0q6MEAQ</a></p>&mdash; Feli #DieHimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1449658612943630343?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>In 2020, I started to <strong>go swimming again and wanted to learn freestyle</strong>. At that time I couldn’t even do two strokes before I started having panic attacks and needed a break to breathe. Read about <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/2021-09-25-one-year-swimming/">my swimming journey</a> if you haven’t already. But now I can’t wait to go swimming again! The second half of 2021 was the time where I improved a lot! Since late November you need to get a negative rapid test at an official test center in order to enter the swimming pool, so I wasn’t swimming a lot anymore. It was too time consuming in my opinion. I also need 30 minutes to get to the swimming pool plus the time to ride to a test center, wait for your turn and for the result... But I will continue with swimming when it’s more safe and a bit less time consuming in 2022.</p><p>My record in 2021 was, that I suprisingly swam 2km in under 1 hour, most of it in freestyle.

At that time I couldn’t even do two strokes before I started having panic attacks and needed a break to breathe. I started a four-week swimming course and by the end of the course I could swim a 25-metres lane, which was an incredible achievement for me (see <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1322298203841155072?s=20">tweet</a>).</p><p>Then, the second COVID wave hit Germany hard and all the swimming pools were closed for almost half a year.</p><p>When I was able to go swimming again this summer, it felt almost like it did when I first started. I definitely couldn’t swim 25 metres anymore (and in the outdoor pool I even had a longer 50-metres lane). It took me many hours of watching tutorials on proper technique and trying again and again and again until I could finally see small progress after some weeks! And somehow I finally could crawl a 50-metres lane! That was an incredible feeling! It actually motivated me so much that I didn’t want to do anything else but swim all day 😅</p><figure>

</figure><p>Now that the outdoor pool season is over again, I went swimming yesterday for the first time in a year in the same indoor pool where I also had my swimming class last year. And you know what? The shorter 25-metres lane helps me so much to just get a liiiiittle break to breathe, so I almost crawled ONE kilometer in half an hour!</p><img src="../../images/2021-09-25-one-year-swimming/freestyle.jpg" alt="Screenshot of swimming workout with 225m breaststroke and 925m freestyle." /><p>Definitely the best feeling ever! #NeverGiveUp</p><p>I can’t wait to go swimming again!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/2021-08-22-well-being</guid><title>How I take care of my well being... or at least try to</title><description>About ten months ago, I started to feel unmotivated, stressed and annoyed very often.

</figure><p><strong>Take it easy and care more about yourself.</strong></p><p>Since then, a lot has changed in my life. I quit my job in February, took some time off and finally started a new job two months ago. Before I started my new job, I had big plans and wanted to do everything better this time, but it turns out that I still struggle to take care of my wellbeing from time to time. I guess it just takes time to get used to my new routines, but the start has been made. I have found out what is good for me and what helps me to relieve stress and feel more focused.</p><h2 id=	"get-enough-sleep">Get Enough Sleep</h2><p>I need quite a lot of sleep to feel relaxed and ready for the next day, about 8-9 hours a night. If I don’t get enough sleep, I feel tired, demotivated and grumpy. I try to make sure I get enough sleep. So I set up the bedtime reminder on my iPhone to remind me that it’s almost time to go to bed. It also activates the "do not disturb" mode on my phone, so I don’t pick up my phone as much in the evening.</p><blockquote><p><strong>How’s it really going at the moment?</strong> I’m tired most of the time. I sleep about 8.5 hours, but in the evening I usually fall asleep on the couch. Then I’m too awake to fall asleep when it’s time for bed. Yeah, it’s complicated 🙈 I always look forward to the weekend to catch up on my sleep. I guess the adjustment of going back to work full time and starting a new job after my time off is exhausting and it takes me a few months to get used to it again.</p></blockquote><h2 id=	"set-boundaries">Set Boundaries</h2><p>I try not to install any work-related apps on my personal phone. That means I don’t set up work emails and I don’t install Slack on my phone. I only answer work-related mail and messages from my Macbook and during my working hours. I’m glad I don’t have to be on call. I also try not to open my Macbook outside of work hours. I’m lucky that I have two different devices, one for personal stuff and one just for work. This means that I can really put the work device away after work and focus on other things in my free time.</p><blockquote><p><strong>How’s it really going at the moment?</strong> I’m very strict about having work-related apps on my phone and uninstalled Slack from my personal phone years ago (that was in late 2017 and I’ve never regretted that decision). But I could be stricter and not open my work Macbook outside of work hours. Since I only started two months ago and there are so many new things happening there, I sometimes feel too tempted to just take a quick glance at something that comes to mind and then I spend half an hour reading Slack messages.</p></blockquote><p>Because of my work as a mobile developer, I use my Macbook and my phone a lot. But I also spend a lot of time on my phone after work. I wanted to reduce my screen time to be more in the moment, reduce the time I spend on social media and maybe read books again from time to time (which I love but often lack the time for). The iOS screentime feature to lock apps after a certain amount of time of use didn’t help me much. When I was bored and saw the app icon on my home screen, for example Twitter, I just wanted to see if there was anything new, so I opened it and just skipped the screentime alert. What helped me more was to uninstall apps completely or remove them from my home screen. If I don’t see the app anymore, I don’t think about it so much during the day.</p><blockquote><p><strong>How’s it really going at the moment?</strong> Great! I check Twitter once or twice a day from my iPad or personal Macbook and have got used to it. It means I no longer feel like I’m missing out on important information. I’d also like to delete Instagram (my second most used app), but I can’t upload Stories from the website, so I installed the app to be able to upload a few pictures from time to time, but the app is hidden on the home screen.</p></blockquote><h2 id=	"be-unavailable-from-time-to-time">Be Unavailable from Time to Time</h2><p>I <em>always</em> have the <strong>"do not disturb" mode</strong> on my work computer activated and the sound on my iPhone <em>always</em> turned off. I reply when I have the time and am not focused on something else. I do not want to be disturbed by notifications.</p><blockquote><p><strong>How’s it really going at the moment?</strong> Great! I’ve actually been doing this for years and I’m so used to it that it confuses me from time to time that some people have their sound on and respond immediately to notifications.</p></blockquote><p>I love having at least <strong>one meeting-free day per week</strong>. On those days I feel very productive and get so much done! If you are not as lucky as I am to have a day without meetings, you can try blocking out a few hours in your work calendar for focus time. During this time you can work on something without interruption. This is visible to everyone, and if someone wants to schedule a meeting during this time, they will see that you are not available.</p><p>To avoid being interrupted, I usually <strong>close apps that might interrupt</strong> me. I close Slack. I close my emails. I activate "Do Not Disturb" mode and reply to my messages when I’m done with my task. But I would inform my team about it during the daily standup, write a short message in the team channel and/or block the time in my calendar. It’s perfectly fine not to respond to everything immediately. Almost everything can wait until tomorrow or next week or after your holiday. You’ll be surprised that even some requests will be solved by themselves 😄</p><blockquote><p><strong>How’s it really going at the moment?</strong> Honestly, I sometimes end up in meetings on the meeting-free day, but that’s fine. I also do a lot of pair programming on those days, but I wouldn’t count that as a meeting. I really enjoy spending the day working in my sweatpants on the couch and don’t have the pressure of having to talk to someone when I don’t want to.</p></blockquote><h2 id=	"take-breaks-and-move">Take Breaks and Move</h2><p>I always know I haven’t moved enough after a long day when I have back pain and feel drained. To prevent this, I try to take breaks every now and then and actually get up from my desk to move around a bit. The best way to clear my head after work is to go for a walk in the fresh air (or go swimming). Sometimes I can do this during the day, for example after a meeting or during my lunch break. The activity helps me think about something other than work and I come back to my desk more open and refreshed.</p><blockquote><p><strong>How’s it really going at the moment?</strong> Pretty good! Since the pandemic, I’ve been walking a lot and I love it. I enjoy going for a walk after work and I manage to do it almost every day. If I do it right after work, I have more success. If I’m already tired lying on the couch, I need a lot of motivation to get up again and go outside. But during the working day, it would help me to take even more breaks and actually get up from my desk.</p></blockquote><h2 id=	"start-meditating">Start Meditating</h2><p>I started meditating six months ago and wish someone had advised me to do it earlier. It would have helped me a lot to manage my stress and focus more on my well-being. I try to do a 10-minute meditation with 7Mind once a day. I can especially recommend meditating to calm down after meetings, to sort out your thoughts or to end the working day and get some distance from work.</p><p>In the months I was unemployed, meditation helped me a lot. There was a lot of uncertainty and I was nervous about the upcoming changes in my life. It helped me to be more aware of the moment, to be mindful, to focus on myself and my surroundings and also to just do nothing for a few minutes.</p><blockquote><p><strong>How’s it really going at the moment?</strong> If I don’t have time to do my meditation, it’s even more important to do it because that means I’m under stress and meditation would help me slow down, breathe deeply and focus on the moment to eventually relieve stress. That’s the theory, but I’m already happy if I find the time and motivation to meditate for 10 minutes once a week. I don’t manage to find time for it regularly during the day. Sometimes it’s hard to find 10 minutes just for me. I make it a priority to focus on it more, because I know it would help me a lot to relieve stress and feel more relaxed.</p></blockquote><h2 id=	"conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>All these things help me feel better in everyday life. But I sometimes struggle to do them. Writing about them has reminded me to keep working on them every day until they become my new routine. So, take it easy, take a deep breath and take care of yourself. 🧡</p><blockquote><p>Things are hard right now for so many.

</figure><p>So, during my vacation in December, <strong>it was finally time to start working on the two-plus years old ticket</strong> to add iPad and iPhone landscape support for <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios">Cineaste App</a>.</p><p>I gave myself a Christmas present and finished the feature on Christmas Eve (see the <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/pull/160">final PR on GitHub</a>). The current version is <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/sAfD3j8m">available for testing on Testflight</a>.</p><p><strong>Feel free to test the app and send feedback!</strong> I would really appreciate it. 🙌</p><p>So, what did I do to add basic iPad and landscape support?</p><h2 id=	"1)-activate-that-checkmark!">1) Activate that Checkmark!</h2><p>The first important step is to <strong>activate that checkmark for iPad</strong> support. You can find that setting in Xcode under the settings of your main target under the tab "General" and the section "Deployment Info".</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/checkmark.jpg" alt="Screenshot of checkmarks to activate iPad support in Xcode" />
    <figcaption>Activate the checkmark for native iPad support in Xcode.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Cineaste App was also pinned to portrait orientation before. If you want to support landscape mode as well, activate the checkmarks for the new orientations too. You can find them directly below the checkmarks for the supported device categories.</p><h2 id=	"2)-run-and-see-what’s-broken">2) Run and See What’s Broken</h2><p>If you’re brave enough, pick an iPad as simulator, run your app, and see what’s broken. In my case, there were some layout issues, but all in all, it didn’t even look <em>that</em> bad. I was surprised! My goal was to create minimal iPad (and iPhone landscape) support that satisfied me for now. Bigger improvements can be made later.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/first-issues.png" alt="Screenshots of the app without further optimization running on iPad and iPhone landscape. There are some issues with the safe area and some images which are way too big." />
    <figcaption>Screenshots of the app running on iPad and iPhone landscape without any further optimization.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Let’s fix the layout problems! But one thing at a time.</p><h2 id=	"3)-layout-issues-and-optimization">3) Layout Issues and Optimization</h2><h3 id=	"large-poster-images-on-ipad">Large Poster Images on iPad</h3><p>On the iPad, the <strong>poster images</strong> (and therefore the cells) <strong>are a little bit too large</strong>.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/poster-size.png" alt="Screenshots of the movie list before and after. On the before screenshot, the poster images are way larger than on the after screenshot." />
    <figcaption>On the left the watchlist with large poster images (before) and on the right with smaller poster images (after).</figcaption>
</figure><p>The images use a "Proportional Width" constraint which is set to ~20% of the screen width. This means on larger devices, the images are larger, too. To make the images a bit smaller on large devices, I programmatically updated the percentage of the constraint depending on the screen size.</p><p>For tips on how to use size classes for different layout on different devices, I can recommend the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sImrtlesfQ">"Size Doesn’t Matter: Building an App for Every iOS Device"</a> by Janina Kutyn from AppBuilders 2019. 🍿</p><h3 id=	"safe-area-issues-on-landscape-mode">Safe Area Issues on Landscape Mode</h3><p>Some <strong>safe area settings</strong> (for the toolbar or the poster) need improvements in the movie detail screen when using the iPhone in landscape mode.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/safe-area.png" alt="Screenshots of the movie detail before and after. On the before screenshot, the toolbar is misplaced and the poster has spacing to the left and right. On the after screenshot, the toolbar is positioned at the bottom and to both sides. The poster also uses the same width." />
    <figcaption>On the left the movie detail with wrong toolbar and poster size (before) and on the right toolbar and poster use the whole width (after).</figcaption>
</figure><p>To fix the issues with the safe area on landscape mode, I constrained the toolbar to not respect the safe area and to use the superview instead. The reason for this is, that toolbars automatically respect safe areas. The <code>UIBarButtonItems</code> are positioned respecting the safe area, so they have enough space on both sides. It doesn’t matter when small parts of the poster are not visible, so I set constraints to the superview on both sides.</p><h3 id=	"fix-table-view-background-color">Fix Table View Background Color</h3><p>It looks weird to have a white area next to the poster. So, the <strong>table view background color</strong> in the lists on iPhone landscape should have no color and show the background color.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/background.png" alt="Screenshots of the movie list before and after. On the before screenshot, the movie cells have a white background. On the after screenshot, the poster and therefore cells are smaller and the background is dark." />
    <figcaption>On the left the watchlist with white background and large poster images (before) and on the right with clear background and smaller cells (after).</figcaption>
</figure><p>There is still an <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/issues/164">unresolved bug</a> (on iOS 14 only), where a table view cell shows a white background when using a long tap to see the contextual menu. Anyone has an idea how to fix this?</p><h3 id=	"movie-detail-and-poster-height">Movie Detail and Poster Height</h3><p>Most of the work has to be done in the movie detail screen in landscape mode. You <strong>shouldn’t see a full screen image when navigating to the screen and then have to scroll a few times</strong> to see the information about a movie.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/large-poster.png" alt="Screenshots of the movie detail before and after. On the before screenshot, the poster is visible full screen, you have to scroll to see movie information. On the after screenshot, the poster is only visible 40% of the screen height and you see some movie information directly underneath." />
    <figcaption>On the left movie detail with a full screen poster (before) and on the right the poster with some movie information directly underneath (after).</figcaption>
</figure><p>The screen is the most complex of the app. It contains two scroll views which are used to add a parallax effect on the poster when scrolling down.</p><p>To prevent seeing a full screen image initially, I added a "Proportional Height" constraint to the poster of 60%. This means when the device is in portrait mode, 60% of the screen displays the poster and you can already see 40% of movie information underneath. When rotating the device, it’s the same logic. A user then sees way less of the poster than in portrait mode, but there’s always the possibility to tap on the poster to see it full screen anyways.</p><p>It sounds simple to add one constraint but I introduced some new bugs with every release and needed some TestFlight versions until I got everything working correctly on iPad portrait and iPhone landscape. 🙈</p><p>The biggest part of work is done 💪 Yay!</p><h2 id=	"4)-prevent-crashes">4) Prevent Crashes</h2><p>It can happen that your app crashes on the iPad, but it doesn’t on the iPhone. Some UI elements, like <code>UIAlertController</code> or <code>UIActivityViewController</code> are displayed in a popover style on the iPad. Therefore they either need a <code>UIBarButtonItem</code> or a <code>sourceView</code> and <code>sourceRect</code> as anchor point to display the popover.</p><p>To check if your app crashes on the iPad, tap every button you have in the app. Additionally, look through your code and search for <code>UIAlertController</code> with style <code>actionSheet</code> or <code>UIActivityViewController</code> and set the information on the property <code>popoverPresentationController</code> to prevent crashes.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let actionSheet = UIAlertController(title: "Contact", message: nil, preferredStyle: .actionSheet)
let action = UIAlertAction(title: "GitHub", style: default) { _ in 
    /* link to GitHub */ 
}
actionSheet.addAction(action)

// 1) use the `UIBarButtonItem` to display the popover
actionSheet.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem = barButtonItem

// 2) use the center of a view to display the popover, for example on a `UITableViewCell`
actionSheet.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = cell
actionSheet.popoverPresentationController?.sourceRect = CGRect(
    x: cell.bounds.midX,
    y: cell.bounds.midY,
    width: 0,
    height: 0
)
</code></pre><h2 id=	"5)-add-more-app-icons">5) Add More App Icons</h2><p>After running the app on the simulator you might have noticed that <strong>your app has no app icon</strong> anymore. We need to add the icon in some more sizes. To do that, choose the "AppIcon" in your Asset Catalog and on the Attributes Inspector, activate another checkmark "iPad". With a tool of your choice (<a href="https://github.com/onmyway133/IconGenerator">I really like "Icon Generator" which is open source</a>), generate the missing assets in the correct sizes and assign them in the Asset Catalog.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/app-icons.jpg" alt="Screenshot of app icons in AssetCatalog in Xcode" />
    <figcaption>Screenshot of App Icons in AssetCatalog in Xcode.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Awesome, that’s it! At this point we are almost good to go!</p><h2 id=	"6)-additional-tasks">6) Additional Tasks</h2><p>To release your app update on the AppStore, you should <strong>record some new iPad screenshots</strong>. To record screenshots for the AppStore, <a href="https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/screenshots/"><code>fastlane screenshots</code></a> could be the tool of your choice.</p><p>When you have an external mouse or touchpad, you <em>can</em> test the <strong>cursor behaviour</strong> and <strong>right click menu</strong> of your app. I didn’t optimize something for that, because it looked already good in my opinion. Maybe this is because I only use default iOS elements and don’t want to have any special behaviour. With a right click, the app displays the contextual actions automatically, which is really cool.</p><h2 id=	"7)-that-last-big-improvement">7) That Last Big Improvement</h2><p>In January, I read about <code>layoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth</code> for improved reading experience (see the <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanMorgan10/status/1267239117521399815">thread with lots of awesome tips</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanMorgan10">@JordanMorgan10</a>). I loved the idea and the movie detail screen (on large devices) was the perfect scenario to use this feature.</p><p>If you’re working with storyboards, you can activate "Follow Readable Width" Layout Guide, instead of "Safe Area Relative Margins". In my case, I changed the layout guide of the stack view which contained the textual content. The stack view automatically adds insets to respect the readable width.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/follow-readable-width.jpg" alt="Screenshot of storyboard with Follow Readable Width Layout Guide in Xcode" />
    <figcaption>Screenshot of Storyboard "Follow Readable Width".</figcaption>
</figure><p>I think this is a major improvement.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/readable-width.png" alt="Screenshots of the movie detail before and after. On the before screenshot, the movie information have a width of the full screen. On the after screenshot, the movie information have a maximum of 130 characters per line, so it’s easier to read a longer text." />

Even though it’s a post from 2016, it’s still relevant. 📚</p><p>I think with all these changes, the iPad version looks ~1000% better than before. But there are still some things which I may want to change in the future.</p><h2 id=	"what’s-missing?">What’s missing?</h2><p>I loved the <a href="https://medium.com/lookup-design/designed-for-ipad-a77f05c4919a">article "Designed for iPad"</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/viditb">@viditb</a> which helped me a lot to identify what I’m still missing. 📚</p><p>The currently missing features are:</p><ul><li>Keyboard Support (maybe use <a href="https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit">KeyboardKit</a> for that?)</li><li>Multi Window Support (but I’m not sure if this is really relevant for this app)</li><li>Drag and Drop Support (but I’m not sure if this is really relevant for this app)</li><li>Improved Layout for iPad (the movie lists still don’t use the optimal layout, a better idea would be to use a split layout with <code>UISplitViewController</code>, a Grid Layout with a <code>UICollectionView</code>, or at least make use of a side bar to use the space on larger devices more efficient)</li></ul><h2 id=	"conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Adding support for iPad adds <em>a lot of complexity</em> to your app. You have to test so much more! There are many more different devices now, there is the split screen layout, you have to test rotating the devices, and and and...</p><p>But I really enjoyed it and it’s worth it!</p><img src="../../images/basic-ipad-support/preview.jpg" alt="An iPad on a table with Cineaste App on screen. It shows a movie detail of the movie Weathering With You." /><p>I had such respect for this task, but in retrospect it was not <em>that</em> difficult in my case. (This impression may vary, of course, depending on what your app does.) Just try it and improve it step by step. It doesn’t have to be perfect right away.</p><hr><p>This was my first experiment with iPad support.

Life was still "normal". But strange things happened there nevertheless. One day it was so unbelievable windy and stormy, we were told to stay at the hotel. The next day the sand arrived with the wind and the air turned orange after some time! See this <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1231627031668051969">before and after picture on twitter</a>. I’ve learned that it’s called a "Calima".

I even got some shoutouts from people during the conference. It’s still a bit surreal for me, but it always makes me happy when others find my sketchnotes useful.</p><p>It was great <strong>to have the sketchnotes integrated on the conference memento page</strong>:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m sooo proud to see my sketchnotes on the memento page! 😍 <a href="https://t.co/jykW4rswPK">https://t.co/jykW4rswPK</a></p>&mdash; Feli #DieHimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1261357163156344832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I think they are perfect next to the youtube video because you can get a quick overview what the talk is about and then decide to watch a talk or not.</p><p>If you’re interested in the talks, you can see all my <strong>sketchnotes from AppBuilders</strong> <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/appbuilders20/">on this website</a> or in <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1259807545364971520">this twitter thread</a>.</p><p>For the first time in my life, <strong>I was mentioned in a newsletter</strong> and I was so surprised and honored!

They also used Hopin. UIKonf is known for their social events the day before the conference. There were many online activities to choose from.

I think next time I will include more breaks and <em>not watch every talk</em>. All the talks are online after the conference, so it’s easy to catch up.

I was able to attend some meetups that I never would have been able to attend because they are far away from where I live. This is a great advantage!</p><h3 id=	"snconnect">SNConnect</h3><p>This year I also participated in my first sketchnoting conference in September - <strong>SNConnect</strong>. It was mostly about interaction and having fun. The conference was self-organized, meaning there was no agenda in advance. Every morning we came together and anyone could submit a topic or ask a question if they just wanted some advice. The sketchnoting community is very open, friendly and the best part, they all love sketchnoting. Who would’ve thought? 😉</p><p>I learned one of my favorite quotes at SNConnect:</p><blockquote><p>"There’s no failing!

It was one of the best decisions to buy it. It really keeps me moving! Especially when I started working from home, I stopped exercising and moving. I had to find activities other than playing soccer. Activities that I could do by myself or with a few others.</p><p>My sister invited me to go <strong>rock climbing</strong> with her in May. I had some bouldering experience before, but I love climbing more because you’re outside in the nature and it’s so fun to spend time with my sister. We go almost every weekend!</p><p>In August, I started going <strong>swimming</strong> two to three times a week. During the summer, the outdoor pools were still open and I could go there after work. I could get my mind off work by riding my bike and going to swim. I was immediately hooked on it. I could do it by myself and enjoy the weather in the summer. I really enjoyed the 50m swim lane. I tried to crawl for a bit, but it just didn’t work for me and I panicked after a few strokes, because I couldn’t get enough air into my lungs. So, I just stuck to breaststroke and I was happy (when the swim lane was long enough and the lane was clear). On my vacation in September, the AirBnB had access to a spa at a hotel next door. They had a pool, but the swim lane was only ~13m long. So annoying, but hey, there was water and it was free 😉 One day, we went to a spa that had a loooong sports pool that was totally empty (of course) instead of the other hot tub and fun areas. I beat my highscore and swam 1km in under 20min! I was so happy the whole day.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I‘ve just swam 1km in under 20min for the first time since August.

I was lucky, that the course was held in spite of Corona. They limited the number of participants from 10 to 5 and instead of 13 there were only 5 sessions. Training with so few others was a total win, our swim coach was able to give a lot more individual feedback. After each session I was so proud to do a little better than last time. In the very last session, I even got the nicest compliment from my swim coach, see <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1322298203841155072">my tweet</a>.</p><p>All in all, the swim was a complete success. I learned so much and I was able to overcome my fears with the front crawl.</p><p>Since November, all the pools have been closed due to lockdown. I really miss swimming and hope I don’t have to relearn everything when they eventually reopen.</p><p>Since I can’t go swimming right now, I bought a <strong>balance board</strong>. It’s like a skateboard without wheels and you can do balance exercises with it in the living room in front of the TV. It’s so simple but also really fun!</p><figure>

</figure><h2 id=	"ipad-and-apple-pencil">iPad and Apple Pencil</h2><p>In August, I gave myself a birthday present: I ordered the iPad Pro 12.9" with the Apple Pencil. I wanted to use it for sketchnoting. A few weeks later, the <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1296048389629587457">Apple Pencil arrived</a>. Nice! I had to stay patient because the iPad took another two weeks to arrive. If you want to know why I bought it, what I was hoping for and how I liked it, I recommend reading my blog post <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/ipad-and-apple-pencil/">"Me, my new iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil"</a>.</p><h2 id=	"vacation-mode-on">Vacation Mode On</h2><p>We were lucky with our vacation planning this year, so we managed to make a road trip to Austria in September without risking too much. It was great to explore the many lakes and hike in the mountains! We were able to go stand up paddling (I LOVE IT), canoeing, hiking and exploring. The pictures speak for themselves.</p><figure>

We did some awesome pair programming sessions and after a while we were able to solve all the code signing issues. Widgets in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cineaste-app/id1402748020">Cineaste App</a> allow you to create a release countdown for your favorite movie that you would like to see. Unfortunately the cinemas were mostly closed this year, so only a few movies were released, but hopefully they will open again soon and it makes even more sense to use the widgets 🤞</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@felibe444</a> and I join the cool kids club and made a widget for her app, Cineaste!<br><br>Because anticipation is the best, you can now track the release date of upcoming movies!<br><br>Get it here:<a href="https://t.co/cFR91N5Reo">https://t.co/cFR91N5Reo</a> <a href="https://t.co/aKx8c8hJhx">pic.twitter.com/aKx8c8hJhx</a></p>&mdash; Xavier Lowmiller (@xavierLowmiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/xavierLowmiller/status/1311911949467254784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2 id=	"workshop-for-hundreds-of-people">Workshop for hundreds of People</h2><p>I knew that in November the NSSpain would take place. The schedule was announced day by day. I bought a ticket. At UIKonf, some people told me, that they would like a workshop on sketchnoting. But it was on such short notice that there was no way I could do it at UIKonf. But maybe I could do it now at NSSpain? Sometimes I’m in a yolo mood. So I just spontaneously messaged the organizer, Luis (<a href="https://twitter.com/Lascorbe">@Lascorbe</a>), on twitter. And he thought it was a great idea and managed to schedule me in, even though the schedule was already set. I’m still surprised that it worked out. Thanks again for the possibility, Luis!</p><p>I’ve already held a few workshops in my company last year. But they were always on-site workshops and in German, my native language. This time it would be virtual and in English! I was a bit freaked out. Two weeks later I managed to achieve a setup so that others could see the things I was drawing on my desk and also see me while I was speaking.</p><figure>

</figure><p>This time the conference lasted 36 hours, so you could watch talks from all over the world and from every time zone. The conference would start on Thursday morning and end on Friday evening. My workshop would take place during the lunch break on Friday. I guessed that some people would see a few of my sketchnotes and maybe they would get interested and join my workshop. So it was the perfect time for the workshop.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Suuuuuper excited about my next workshop!

Climbing is really fun, you’re out in the nature and #frankenjura has so much to offer. I also love that I get to spend time with my sister. Swimming in the summer was great, especially after work to clear my head. After a few weeks, I could see that I was gaining speed and endurance. I miss swimming a lot.</p><p>Definitely the workshop at NSSpain! I am so proud and happy that so many people participated and enjoyed it.</p><p>Most days this year, cooking was the highlight of the day for me. I started taking a picture of each lunch. Enjoy the video and I hope you don’t get hungry watching it 😉🍽.</p><p>

I’ve always used pen and paper for it. As an iOS developer, I spend much of my time on my MacBook and my iPhone and somehow I wanted to hide from all the digital stuff. I also love to have one book with all sketchnotes, and to be able to browse through the book and remember everything easily.</p><img src="../../images/ipad-and-apple-pencil/header.jpg" alt="A sketchnote in a book and pencils next to it" /><h2 id=	"what-has-changed-my-opinion?">What has changed my opinion?</h2><p>The release of Scribble for iPad, in September 2020, really made me want to have an iPad with Apple Pencil again. It’s always Apple and their really good marketing videos. They always get me. 🙈</p><p><em>(For more about Scribble, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10106/">Meet Scribble for iPad</a> or my <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/sketchnotes/wwdc20-meet-scribble-for-ipad/">sketchnote about it</a>)</em></p><h2 id=	"what-i-have-wished-for...">What I have wished for...</h2><h3 id=	"first-wish">First wish</h3><p>Sometimes, I’m <strong>having trouble to start projects</strong>, like sketchnotes, letterings or just drawing random things. I want to do it, but I’m afraid to waste paper because the result wouldn’t look like I imagined it and I have to start over.</p><p>I know drawing and sketchnoting isn’t about perfection and I have to learn a lot, so I shouldn’t expect a perfect result from me. But this thought simply kept me from starting.</p><p>I wished that the iPad would help me with this. To start projects and to save paper.</p><h3 id=	"second-wish">Second wish</h3><p>Another thing that I often have issues with, is <strong>dividing the space so that everything fits on one page</strong>. This is really difficult when you don’t know what the talk is about in detail and you do a live sketchnote. Sometimes, I started to write too big for not so important information and had no place for the important things at the end.</p><p>Using an iPad would definitely help me with that because I could resize things or simply change the canvas size.</p><h3 id=	"third-wish">Third wish</h3><p>There are <strong>a lot of manual steps to digitalize the paper sketchnote to an image</strong> which can then be shared on social media.</p><p>To share a sketchnote, I use Apples <em>Files</em> app to scan the sketchnote. Sadly, this always results in a <code>.pdf</code>, so I have to airdrop it to my MacBook and convert it to <code>.jpg</code> (or something else) because <code>.pdf</code> can’t be posted on twitter. When converting the document, I always increase the distance to the edges, so the content has a bit more space. After the conversion and the editing, I can finally share the image on twitter.</p><p>Of course, using an iPad would help me with that because I can use the same device to edit, export and share the image.</p><h3 id=	"fourth-wish">Fourth wish</h3><p>Of course, one of my goals is to improve my apps for the iPad, but for that, I have to first learn about "iPad patterns". Which kind of navigation should be used, a tab bar or a side bar? Should this be a detail view or a pop up? So, when I now use the iPad more often I want to have a detailed look at some existing apps and then to improve mine.</p><hr><p>So, one evening, I just ordered it. Sadly the order took four weeks. The Apple Pencil even arrived one week earlier, and I had two wait another week until I could finally use it. It was my deserved belated birthday present.</p><figure>

</figure><hr><h2 id=	"the-"get-to-know"-phase">The "Get To Know" Phase</h2><p>Directly after unpacking and initial set up, I downloaded some of my favorite apps which I already use on my iPhone. My first additional purchase was the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/procreate/id425073498">Procreate</a> app. This is one of the most famous app for drawing with Apple Pencil support. The app is simple on the first glance, so it’s easy to start with and you can instantly try out all the different brushes. But the app can also be a bit overwhelming because you can do soooo much!</p><p>Procreate has an awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlpSQCrjuGkoZHyUyO3cNEMyYPNkF0Hne">"Learn to Procreate" Playlist</a> in YouTube which are 2 to 3 minute videos explaining features of the app.</p><p><strong>Tip: To not be overwhelmed, try to only learn one feature in a week and not everything at once.</strong></p><p>It’s so fun to browse through YouTube and peek into Procreate tutorials from amazing artists and try out new things. There are tons of Procreate tutorials in YouTube!</p><figure>

</figure><h2 id=	"how-do-i-like-it-now?">How do I like it now?</h2><p>After using the iPad for about six weeks now... I can say, it was a journey from being super excited at first, over overwhelmed, to pretty confident. It’s definitely different to draw on an iPad than on paper, but you’re getting used to it after some time. The <em>Paperlike</em> iPad Screen Protector helped me with this. It feels (and sounds) a lot more like drawing on paper.</p><p>iOS 14 was released and I could try out Scribble. I really like it because I don’t have to put the pencil away to type something. But from time to time I find myself activating Scribble when I don’t want to use it. Sometimes I start typing in "textfields" I haven’t even seen, so I constantly rename my color palettes by mistake. Mh, maybe that’s just me.</p><h3 id=	"were-my-wishes-fulfilled?">Were my wishes fulfilled?</h3><ul><li>Help me with getting started. Check. ✅</li><li>Help me dividing space.

Last week was <a href="https://appbuilders.ch/">AppBuilders</a> and this week was <a href="https://uikonf.com/">UIKonf</a>! The organizers of both conferences did an awesome job! Kudos to them! 👏</p><p>I love visiting conferences! But two days full of conference talks are hard! It’s hard <strong>for your brain</strong> to stay focused and to process the things you’ve heard. It’s hard <strong>for your back</strong> when you sit on your chair all the time, not only during the talks but also during the little breaks when you join sessions to meet others. It’s hard <strong>for your fingers</strong> when you make sketchnotes two days long.</p><p>But to be honest, conferences are also exhausting when they are not online but you have to be on site (maybe even more). I always need some rest after a conference to process all the things I’ve experienced. <strong>Pro tip: take a day after the conference off if possible!</strong> Having a remote conference, a big advantage for sketchnoters is, that you have your own space for your pens, sketchbooks and stuff and you don’t have to make sketchnotes on your knees. This was really nice! 🙃</p><figure style="max-width:500px">

</figure><h2 id=	"sketchnote-all-the-talks!-why-would-i-do-that?">Sketchnote all the talks! Why would I do that?</h2><p>Watching talks from home, makes it easier to get distracted – at least for me! Nobody will see (and blaim) you, when you open a tab in your browser and scroll through twitter... or when you grab your phone and answer some messages.</p><p><strong>Sketchnoting helps to stay focused on the talk.</strong> The brain is busy. Busy listening to the speaker and filtering things out if they are important or not so much. The hand is busy. Busy drawing some little sketches or writing down an important quote of the speaker.</p><p>After around 10 talks, it will be hard to stay focused even when you make sketchnotes. But it’s ok. Everybody feels like this (I think 😅). After the first day, one of my fingers started to hurt so much while holding a pen, I actually had to tape it (this is #veryHardWork 😜).</p><p><strong>You honor the speakers.</strong> All speakers have invested a lot of work into their preparation of the talk and their presentation. None of my sketchnotes would exist without them! Always tag and reference the speaker in your posts, so they get notified and others can easily find more content of the speaker.</p><p><strong>It’s a great summary.</strong> I use my sketchnotes as a summary for what happened in the talk. On conferences, other participants often want to know what your favorite talk was. It may happen that you don’t even know what to answer because it happened <em>so much</em> during the day, that you forgot everything. A small look into my book helps me quickly and every talk is present again in front of my inner eye and I’m a bit more able to answer the question. Also, people who didn’t take part in the conference can get an impression what happened in the talk and can decide if they want to watch the video or not.</p><p><strong>It’s a lot of fun.</strong> I love sketchnoting! I use pen and paper for it and since I’ve started with sketchnoting in November 2018, I’ve already finished two sketchbooks which are full of sketchnotes. I love to riffle through the books and see how my style has evolved and remind me of the talks, meetups and conferences I’ve visited the last years. You can see a big difference between the style of my notes <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/uikonf/">from UIKonf 2019 and UIKonf 2020</a> (There are 12 months in between!).</p><h2 id=	"tips-and-tricks?">Tips and tricks?</h2><p>I’ve invested some time into <strong>preparation</strong>. Before the conference started, I wrote all talk titles, speaker names and their twitter handles on my notes, as well as the conference name and my twitter handle.</p><img src="../../images/sketchnotes-on-online-conferences/sketchnote-preparation.jpg" alt="Sketchnote header, conference and credits signature are highlighted on the sketchnote." /><p>This <strong>saved me a lot of time</strong> during the actual conference. Between the talks is mostly not much time and all I had to do was to wait for the next talk to begin and start by adding the content.</p><hr><p>🤩 I’m so happy when other people like my sketchnotes and tell me that they actually find them useful! It makes everything much more worth!</p><p>Even though, nothing would ever stop me from making sketchnotes and nothing should ever stop you 😉</p><h2 id=	"links-to...">Links to...</h2><h3 id=	"#appbuilders20">#AppBuilders20</h3><ul><li><a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/appbuilders20/">AppBuilders 2020 sketchnotes</a> on this website</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1259807545364971520">Twitter thread</a> with my sketchnotes</li><li><a href="https://2020.appbuilders.ch/memento">Memento page</a> with links to talks in YouTube</li></ul><h3 id=	"#uikonf2020">#UIKonf2020</h3><ul><li><a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/uikonf20/">UIKonf 2020 sketchnotes</a> on this website</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1262396003413643269">Twitter thread</a> with my sketchnotes</li><li>Talks are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdr22uU_wISpu7T6JWq7eMSxP0tYcmXcB">available on YouTube</a> since June</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/welcome-sketchnotes</guid><title>Welcome, Sketchnotes!</title><description>When I released my website in January 2020, I was a hundred percent sure, that I wanted to add my sketchnotes in it as well... but I needed more time to think about how to implement it and I was also unsure about how the layout and navigation should look like.</description><link>https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/welcome-sketchnotes</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id=	"welcome,-sketchnotes!">Welcome, Sketchnotes!</h1><p>Some years ago, a friend of me asked why I don’t have my own website where I could host my content. To this time, I was mostly active on Instagram where I posted my photographs and on Twitter to post some things every now and then. To have my own website was something I’ve never thought of before. Why should I invest time to create a website, when mostly everyone uses platforms like Instagram or Twitter to consume content on a daily basis?</p><p>But after this conversation the first seed was planted. The more I thought about it, the more I’ve realised that I could have full control over the content I post on my website. I won’t stop posting things on other platforms, but now I can refer to my website when I share content. Besides, it feels so <strong>awesome to have my own little place</strong> in the big world of internet, where everything which matters to me can be discovered. A place with things I’ve created and am proud of.</p><p>When I released this website in January 2020, I was a hundred percent sure, that I wanted to display my sketchnotes as well... but I needed more time to think about how to implement it and I was also unsure about how the layout and navigation should look like.</p><p>But three months later, I had a plan!</p><h2 id=	"what-was-the-plan?-which-things-needed-to-be-done?">What was the plan? Which things needed to be done?</h2><h3 id=	"1)-navigation-to-access-the-sections">1) Navigation to access the sections</h3><p>I needed a navigation bar to access the new section. That was one of the easier things, because I’ve already had some example in mind, which I could get inspired by.</p><p>It’s a simple white rectangle with (currently) two sections "Posts" and "Sketchnotes". When you hover over one of the elements, you see a line under the text. This looks the same when the section is selected.</p><img src="../../images/welcome-sketchnotes/navigation-bar-hover.jpg" alt="Screenshot of hover State of Navigation Bar with underlined section" /><h3 id=	"2)-preview-of-recent-sketchnotes">2) Preview of recent sketchnotes</h3><p>On the first page of my website, you see the most recent items. I wanted to add my latest sketchnotes to this page. This is only a small part from the content of page <code>/sketchnotes</code> with the same design. So, let’s jump directly to the list of all sketchnotes.</p><h3 id=	"3)-list-of-all-sketchnotes">3) List of all sketchnotes</h3><p>The page <code>/sketchnotes</code> should give an overview of all my sketchnotes. You should see a list of all sketchnotes which are displayed with smaller images as thumbnails.</p><img src="../../images/welcome-sketchnotes/sketchnote-list.jpg" alt="Screenshot of page with list of skecthnote" /><p>To have a website which is <strong>performant and loads its content quickly</strong> without using your whole monthly mobile data, was very important to me.</p><p>Google gives a nice insight on why optimizing images is so important:</p><blockquote><p>Images often account for most of the downloaded bytes on a page. As a result, optimizing images can often yield some of the largest byte savings and performance improvements: the fewer bytes the browser has to download, the less competition there is for the client’s bandwidth and the faster the browser can download and render content on the screen.</p></blockquote><p>(<em>see the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeImages">article: Optimize Images</a></em>)</p><p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/die-himmelstraeumerin-blog/blob/master/create-thumbnails.sh">script</a> to easily generate thumbnails for the list. The script uses the power of <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to resize all images and to save the resized image as new file with a suffix <code>-small</code>. It has already saved me tons of hours with resizing images!</p><p>Creating the layout for the list was a challenge for me. Every sketchnote has <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> and they exist in <strong>both orientations</strong>, landscape and portrait. I wanted to display the latest sketchnotes on top of the screen, to be able to scroll down and see how the sketchnotes developed. Additionally, I wanted a <strong>CSS only solution</strong>, because I like to keep it simple whenever it’s possible.</p><p>I’m a newbie when it comes to HTML and CSS, so I had to learn a lot about different HTML layout techniques. There are many different tutorials for photo grid layouts out there and I’ve tried different kinds, like CSS grid, flexbox and finally used a column layout, which worked best for me.</p><p>In the next image there are four layout variations. In each variation the numbers from 1 to 12 display the creation date of a sketchnote from new to old, which means sketchnote 1 is the latest and sketchnote 12 is the oldest. The blue lines display which side should have the same length for every image. I don’t want to crop the sketchnotes in preview and images shouldn’t be distorted (who would ever want this?!), one side – either height or width – needs to have a fix length for all images.</p><img src="../../images/welcome-sketchnotes/html-layout.jpg" alt="Four possible list layouts" /><ul><li>(1) is what I actually wanted to achieve</li><li>(2) is what I was able to achieve with <strong>grid layout</strong></li><li>(3) is what I was able to achieve with <strong>flexbox</strong></li><li>(4) is what I was able to achieve with <strong>column layout</strong></li></ul><p>Layout 4 is nearly the same as Layout 1 and is therefore <em>nearly perfect</em>. Only the order of the images isn’t like I wanted. Nevertheless, I chose this layout to be the final one (for the moment).</p><p><em>EDIT: in November 2020, I changed the layout to flexbox layout for various reasons (<a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/die-himmelstraeumerin-blog/commit/e24c8f958bcc5e34dfff9850dd13bf380a08b44d">see commit</a>):</em></p><blockquote><p>1) To fix order of sketchnotes in <code>/sketchnotes</code>. The items are now displayed from top left to bottom right. To make this possible, every sketchnote has the same aspect ratio and is filled up with white space. 2) To remove weird visual effect when refreshing <code>/sketchnotes</code>. 3) To remove a bug with shadow and link in column-layout.</p></blockquote><h3 id=	"4)-detail-of-sketchnote">4) Detail of sketchnote</h3><p>To layout the detail page of a sketchnote was easier to achieve than the list. The page consists of different elements, mainly one big image. As some sketchnotes are too high to see them complete directly without scrolling, I added a link on the image to open it in a new tab in full resolution. In the new tab, the browser navigation features can be used to zoom in and out.</p><img src="../../images/welcome-sketchnotes/sketchnote-detail.jpg" alt="Screenshot of detail page of skecthnote" /><p>The static HTML for this website is generated with <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a>. To have as less manual work as possible when adding a new sketchnote, most of the HTML for the detail page is generated. This means, I add the content for the page in a markdown file, add some logic how the HTML should look like and Publish generates the HTML from the mix of content and logic.</p><p>A markdown file for a sketchnote detail page looks something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-markdown">---

</code></pre><p>Sadly there is nothing like a <code>install</code> phase (yet?), which I know from Travis or Gitlab CI. So, there is some duplicated code in here for installing the dependencies for each job. But there is a solution for it. You can create a "Install Dependency" job and the other jobs then wait for this to finish but I didn’t try it out yet. I found this in the <a href="https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/the-same-dependency-in-all-workflows-jobs/td-p/37266">GitHub Community Forum</a> where I discovered some useful hints and tips.</p><h4 id=	"2.-delete-<code>.travis.yml</code>">2. Delete <code>.travis.yml</code></h4><p>And when you have added the jobs in the new file, you can delete your <code>.travis.yml</code> file and you are already finished.

This seems to happen instantly with GitHub Actions, I didn’t wait for 30 seconds to see that the jobs have already started. So, instead of waiting ~12 minutes for all jobs to finish with Travis CI, I now wait ~4 minutes. This is such a huge difference!</p><h4 id=	"marketplace">Marketplace</h4><p>There is a ton of community work available to use. You can browse through the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">marketplace</a> and you can imagine to automate everything, you could ever think of.

So, I used <code>on: [push, pull_request]</code> as trigger, but then the jobs are running twice when creating a pull request. The solution is this:</p><pre><code>on:

I learned a ton and I tried to be more present in the internet because I’ve learned sharing is caring. I think, even when nobody’s reading this, it’s worth it, because it’s a good summary for me and it helps me to think about my experiences. This year I’ve read through my tweets to discover which topics concerned me the most.</p><h2 id=	"accessibility">Accessibility</h2><p><em>(01/2019 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>My interest in accessibility started after I saw my mom using a smartphone for her first time in March. I’ve read somewhere that you can only be really motivated about fixing accessibility issues if you know someone who is affected, if you can feel empathy for someone – I think this is true. Sadly. Sadly, because we all are getting older and if we build products, which are accessible, we are building them for our future selves. I think, there is simply no excuse for not building apps accessible <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1106682450778959874?s=20">(see my tweet)</a>.</p><p>I learned more and more about different aspects of accessibility, like accessibility specific for iOS apps but also inclusion in general... and I still learn every day! I want to spread awareness, that <strong>accessibility is not just a nice-to-have</strong>, it’s a must! It should be as self-evident to build products accessible as writing unit tests. So, I held a talk about it at our clients’ office where I gave my best to change the mindset about who needs an accessible app and how important it is to build an app for everyone. The main target group of this talk was people from our business and lead team. See my slides about it on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/fbernutz/building-apps-for-everyone">speakerdeck</a>.</p><p>I received great feedback. Some of the attendees didn’t even know about the accessibility features in iOS and they found it really important to learn about this topic. So, I put my words into my very first blog post to reach one or two more people. I was (and still am) so proud!</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is Global Accessibility Awareness Day <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAAD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GAAD</a>.

Every day in December they’ve published an article about accessibility with very diverse topics. What I loved most about it, that I could discover so many new people who are accessibility lovers. It’s so good to see that there are actually many people out there, who also want to spread awareness and who share their experiences!</p><h2 id=	"cineaste-app">Cineaste App</h2><p><em>(01/2019 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>For those who don’t know about my relationship to this app. I’m a contributer on <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios">GitHub</a> and I love working on it, because I can decide on which features I’m working next or just try out some iOS features, which I always wanted to learn.</p><p>I had the plan to update the layout for all screens for a long time and on the beginning of this year, I could finally implement the new designs. I like it much better now and it was so much fun to design screens on my own. See these pull requests with some screenshots for the difference: <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/pull/74">Update Search View #74</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/pull/82">Update Movie Detail Layout #82</a></p><p>When I implemented the layout changes, I also made everything work with <strong>Dynamic Type and Voice Over</strong>. Surprisingly, it took me only half a day to make the layout work completely without any warnings on small and on large devices with small and large fonts. So, I’ve learned, it’s better to do it correct one time, instead of having problems with different device sizes every time!</p><blockquote class=" twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Took me nearly half a day, but I built the new search layout in Cineaste to *truly* support dynamic type – without any constraint warnings or broken layouts on a small iPhone 5 with iOS 10 as well as on an iPhone X with iOS 12 with small and extra large system fonts! So proud! <a href="https://t.co/zqym3x85oR">pic.twitter.com/zqym3x85oR</a>

</blockquote><p>We tested the iOS App on an event called <a href="https://usability-testessen.org/">"Usability Test-Essen"</a>. This event takes part in many cities in Germany. On one evening, a handful of testers test your product with some scenarios you give them. It was very interesting to see what was easy to understand for the tester and what they didn’t even discover. It was an exhausting but amazing experience! I highly recommend to test your own product but also to test other products.</p><blockquote class=" twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">

</blockquote><p>With the release of iOS 13 in autumn there came a lot new features. Mainly interesting for the user – <strong>Dark Mode</strong>! Actually, I feared implementing it, because I had no plan how a dark design of Cineaste should look like and it looked like a lot of work... So, I disabled Dark Mode for iOS 13 in the first step. After a few months, I decided to go for it again. Even Instagram had its own dark mode, so I can do it as well. I started to make a design first, to have a plan for the implementation and to think about how it could look like. It was way easier than I thought it would be and it looked kinda good. I got super motivated when I had a screenshot of the new design on my phone. I wanted to start implementing it right away. It only took me two evening/nights to implement the new design. To be able to test the implemented dark mode on my device, was such a great feeling. I wonder why I feared starting with it at all. I looove the new dark mode 😍</p><p>See my <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1189439995716816897?s=20">tweets</a> about it and the <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/pull/114">pull request</a> with some screenshots, if you are interested how it was implemented.</p><h2 id=	"sketchnoting">Sketchnoting</h2><p><em>(11/2018 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>Sketchnoting came into my life in November 2018. I was at <a href="https://dachfest.com/">DACHFest</a> and took part in a sketchnoting workshop with <a href="https://twitter.com/lariki">@lariki</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MiBLT">@MiBLTl</a>. DACHFest was the first conference where I tried to sketchnote every talk. I found out quickly how much it helped me to stay concentrated during the presentations. I also liked the aspect to have easy reminders for every talk. Sketchnotes are perfect for recaps after a conference.<br><br>I visited AppBuilders in April in Lugano, CH <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1126075162032525312">(AppBuilders Twitter Thread)</a> and UIKonf in May in Berlin, GER <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1134143368706088960">(UIKonf Twitter Thread)</a> and sketchnoted all talks...</p><p>What can I say, <strong>I love doing sketchnotes</strong>.</p><p>After three conferences full of talks (so about 30 sketchnotes) you could see some progress, how the notes got better and better (visually). This is a pure subjective impression but they looked more like something which really should look like it looks and not some kind of random output.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">

</blockquote><p>I talked a lot about sketchnoting at work too and especially in WWDC season, of course, I did sketchnotes of the sessions I’ve watched and showed them to my colleagues 😉 I think, it was just a matter of time, when a colleague suggested that I should do a workshop about sketchnoting at my company. I immediately declined, because I was just a beginner myself! But one day later, I said that I want to do it. Because... sharing is caring! So, I prepared my very first workshop <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1159192552228163584?s=20">(see tweet)</a>. I was so scared but also excited, because sketchnoting is simply my favorite. I’m so glad, that I got so much support at my company!</p><p>I was overwhelmed by my feeling after I did my first workshop in August. Everybody liked it and I remember like it was yesterday, that I wanted to scream out loud, that I did it and wanted to tell everybody about it with a big, big smile on my face.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">

</blockquote><p>In August/September, I made one sketchnote of every day of my vacation, even though I never was a diary writer. Especially on vacation, I often have the feeling I’m overwhelmed of all the impressions that I forget what I experienced over the day. Sketchnotes help me to think about what happened and to calm down after a long day. If you are interested how a sketchnote of vacations can look like, you can watch a small video of my sketchnotes <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1172838391836303360">in this tweet</a>.</p><p>I also had my first sketchnoting "job". I was asked to make sketchnotes for my company at the "Agile Leadership" conference in October in Nuremberg. Why not giving it a try, if some of the sketchnotes are worth sharing, we could share it with the companys twitter account. The topic of the conference was nothing iOS related, so I felt a bit uncomfortable with sketchnoting about something with so many abstract words... How could you do a sketch about "agile transformations"?! Mh, but I was ready for this challenge and you can see the sketchnotes in this <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1179095476731351040">thread</a>. What I loved most, was that sketchnoting was an ice breaker at this conference. Some people talked to me just because they saw me taking notes and asked me questions about it.</p><p>In the second and third workshop about sketchnoting in my company in October and December I could try out different workshop elements like some new sketching excercises, like sketching your neighbour with your eyes closed. This was so fun and with these little challenges it felt a lot more like a workshop instead of a talk. See my tweets of the <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1182651589682749440?s=20">second</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1203015570175729669">third</a> workshop.</p><h2 id=	"a-project-in-two-years">A Project In Two Years</h2><p><em>(01/2018 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>I am now in the same project at my company for two years.

</blockquote><p>I discovered the iOS repository for the Critical Mass, called <a href="https://github.com/criticalmaps/criticalmaps-ios">Critical Maps</a>. It has about 80 stars in GitHub which is a very good number for an app. It was fun to contribute to the project and to receive feedback from the other contributers. One of the main contributers invited me to join their organization. Now, I can also review pull requests and merge them and discuss in their slack channel which was a pretty big deal for me, because there were a lot people I didn’t know.

But in reality, we all find tons of excuses for not going that extra mile …</p><p>When you add new features to your app, nobody will test accessibility features (I really hope there are some exceptions out there). You don’t even get the time and money to implement these features. So, at some point, you as a developer, simply don’t think about it anymore.</p><hr><h2 id=	"a-few-weeks-ago,-i-had-a-key-experience.">A few weeks ago, I had a key experience.</h2><p>My mom is visually and motor impaired and she got her <em>first</em> smartphone (Hallo Mama 👋). I never even imagined that this could be a thing for her, but one day, she just called a friend and went out to buy a used Android smartphone. She asked me for help to set everything up, install some apps, and explain some things here and there.</p><p>I observed closely how she interacted with her new phone. It was nearly impossible for her to type in her personal information to create a Google account, because her fine motor skills were too weak. The difficulties she had using the smartphone really blew my mind.</p><p>The first thing we did, was to scale up the system font size, and we realized that even the Android system itself is not fully optimized for accessibility.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Screenshot of an Android Smartphone where the font size is enlarged and half of the text is not readable because it's trimmed</figcaption>
</figure><p>One might think that increasing the system font size that much is a rare use case. And some people might even say, that this would only be relevant for less than about 5% of their product’s target group. It would not be worth the money to build something only for these few people, so they can be ignored! Right?</p><p>Ehh… No.</p><h2 id=	"who-actually-needs-accessibility-features?">Who actually needs accessibility features?</h2><p>First, everybody thinks of <strong>permanently</strong> disabled people, like people with only one arm, and blind or deaf people.</p><p>But there are also <strong>temporarily</strong> disabled people, like someone who has a broken arm and can only use one hand to operate a smartphone.</p><p>People move in different environments. So, there are also <strong>situational</strong> disabilities. When you are a new parent, you carry your baby on your arm all the time. Therefore you suddenly just have one hand to use your smartphone. Abilities can change dramatically, depending on the environment you are in.</p><blockquote><p>“Accessibility is not just about making information available to users with disabilities — it’s about making information available to everyone, regardless of their capabilities or situation.” — Apple</p></blockquote><figure>

But Android is also not that bad with Google Assistant (and all the features, like Live Caption, Live Relay, and Live Transcribe they have recently announced at Google I/O).

You can navigate through elements on the screen by swiping to the right to focus the next element.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Normally, the position and the spacing between elements like text and images connects the content, but users with vision loss can’t see this. The <strong>content should be bundled semantically</strong>, so it’s read aloud together and will be focused as one element.</p><h3 id=	"reading-support">Reading Support</h3><blockquote><p>“You see it. iPhone says it.” — Apple</p></blockquote><p>Turn on <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/learning/">Speak Screen</a> and swipe down from the top of the screen with two fingers, or just tell Siri to Speak Screen, to have all the content on pages read back to you.</p><p>You can also select text to be read aloud for you with a “Speak” button. This is extremely useful for people who find it easier to listen to a voice rather than read a text.</p><figure>

</figure><hr><h3 id=	"about-this-post">About this post</h3><p><em>Two weeks ago, I gave a presentation about this topic at our client’s workspace with the goal to change the mindset about who needs an app that supports accessibility features, and how important it is to build an app for everyone. The main target group of this talk was people from our business and lead team. I received great feedback. Some of the attendees didn’t even know about these features and they found it really important to learn about this topic. So, I put my words into this blog post to reach one or two more people (and to remember the points I was talking about).</em></p><p><em>You can find my slides from the talk here: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/fbernutz/building-apps-for-everyone">https://speakerdeck.com/fbernutz/building-apps-for-everyone</a></em></p><h3 id=	"additional-links">Additional Links</h3><p><em>The following resources were used for the quotes in this blog post and are a good starting point to get more information about Accessibility and Inclusive Design.
