I really liked it, because it helped me to process the year and to remember what happened. Obviously, 2020 is marked by the pandemic. I wish so badly that this will be over soon! A few days ago, I watched "<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/508442-soul">Soul</a>" and it reminded me <strong>not to wait for something but to enjoy the little things</strong>. So, I need to write this down to remember myself that not everything was bad and that I've learned and experienced a lot.</p><h2>Adventurous Tenerife</h2><p>In February, I made vacations on Tenerife on the Canary Islands! Life was still "normal". But crazy things happened there nevertheless. One day it was so unbelievable windy and stormy, we were told to stay at the hotel. The next day the sand arrived with the wind and the air turned orange after some time! See this <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1231627031668051969">before and after picture on twitter</a>. I've learned that it's called a "Calima". Calimas are hot wind storms that carry sand towards the Canary Islands from the Sahara, capable of lifting dust thousands of meters above the Atlantic Ocean. The air smelled and felt dirty and sandy. Again, we were told to stay at the hotel, because you could have difficulties to breath. Definitely felt like a kind of apocalypse.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">See you next time, adventurous Tenerife üåµ‚òÄÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/Nh7kjITL9b">pic.twitter.com/Nh7kjITL9b</a></p>&mdash; diehimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1232620096490741760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>Welcome, Sketchnotes!</h2><p>In March, I integrated my sketchnotes on this website. It was a lot of work, but I could learn much about layouts with CSS. I wrote <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/welcome-sketchnotes/">a blog post</a> about the idea, the process and the implementation (see the <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1244202896339742720">tweet</a>).</p><p>It feels awesome to have my own little place in the big world of the internet, where everything which matters to me can be discovered. A place with things I've created and am proud of.</p><h2>Home Office Time</h2><p>Since the mid of March and the first lockdown in Germany, I'm working from home.</p><img src="../../images/thoughts-about-2020/home-office-time.jpg" alt="Lettering next to a keyboard which says it's home office time" /><p>To work from home from one day to the other was really hard for me, I missed the ride to the office with my bicycle to get awake in the morning and the ride back home to clear my head. I had to learn that I need to move more and differently than before. Now, nine months later, I love working from home, especially the flexibility, the silence and the comfort.</p><h2>Sharing Knowledge</h2><p>Since April, I had the chance to teach iOS development with one of my iOS colleagues to three other developers which mostly had no experience with mobile development and iOS in specific. It was really fun to think about what are the most important topics, to prepare different topics and to see how fast and how much they've learned. I'm super proud of them, because they can now implement iOS tasks mostly on their own and we're now a bigger group of iOS developers - like a little community.</p><h2>Conferences from the Living Room</h2><p>In May, I took part in two online conferences which I've visited in person last year. It's a different experience, but I wouldn't miss it at any chance!</p><h3>What I miss on online conferences</h3><ul><li>the random conversations between the talks</li><li>the food and the drinks</li><li>the partys, where you see some people you've already talked to earlier</li><li>traveling to beautiful cities, like Lugano</li></ul><h3>What I like about online conferences</h3><ul><li>possibility to pause the video, take a break and revisit later</li><li>watch talks from wherever you want</li><li>way cheaper!</li><li>use all the pencils you have for sketchnoting</li><li>use your own desk for sketchnoting</li><li>speakers could answer questions in chat during the talk</li></ul><p>Read my opinion on <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/sketchnotes-on-online-conferences/">why you should sketchnote on online conferences</a>, if you are interested in it.</p><h3>AppBuilders</h3><p>AppBuilders was my very first online conference. They used <a href="https://hopin.com/https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a> as conference platform tool. You could actively talk in smaller groups or just listen to others. It made it especially easy for introverts.</p><p>I made sketchnotes of all talks and posted them after each talk on twitter. This got some attention and many people interacted with the tweets. I even got some shoutouts from people during the conference. It's still a bit surreal for me, but it always makes me happy when others find my sketchnotes useful.</p><p>It was great <strong>to have the sketchnotes integrated on the conference memento page</strong>:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m sooo proud to see my sketchnotes on the memento page! üòç <a href="https://t.co/jykW4rswPK">https://t.co/jykW4rswPK</a></p>&mdash; diehimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1261357163156344832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I think they are perfect next to the youtube video because you can get a quick overview what the talk is about and then decide to watch a talk or not.</p><p>If you're interested in the talks, you can see all my <strong>sketchnotes from AppBuilders</strong> <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/appbuilders20/">on this website</a> or in <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1259807545364971520">this twitter thread</a>.</p><p>For the first time in my life, <strong>I was mentioned in a newsletter</strong> and I was so surprised and honored! If you want, check out <a href="https://mailchi.mp/6db5b30bcb29/swiftlee-weekly-12318222">the specific issue,</a> where I was mentioned in the SwiftLee newsletter by Antoine van der Lee (<a href="https://twitter.com/twannl">@twannl</a>).</p><h3>UIKonf</h3><p>UIKonf took place just a week after AppBuilders. They also used Hopin. UIKonf is known for their social events the day before the conference. There were many online activities to choose from. I escaped from an "online escape room" with others and it was really fun and entertaining.</p><p>I also took sketchnotes of all the talks and that was really a lot for two days. I think next time I will include more breaks and <em>not watch every talk</em>. All the talks are online after the conference, so it's easy to catch up. UIKonf even used a private Youtube livestream, so you could pause and resume whenever you wanted!</p><p>See all my <strong>sketchnotes from UIKonf</strong> <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/uikonf20/">on this website</a> or in <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1262396003413643269">this twitter thread</a>.</p><h3>Meetups</h3><p>Although it's different to meet other people remotely and attend a conference in person, I loved that so many events and meetups were virtual. I was able to attend some meetups that I never would have been able to attend because they are far away from where I live. This is a great advantage!</p><h3>SNConnect</h3><p>This year I also participated in my first sketchnoting conference in September - <strong>SNConnect</strong>. It was mostly about interaction and having fun. The conference was self-organized, meaning there was no agenda in advance. Every morning we came together and anyone could submit a topic or ask a question if they just wanted some advice. The sketchnoting community is very open, friendly and the best part, they all love sketchnoting. Who would've thought? üòâ</p><p>I learned one of my favorite quotes at SNConnect:</p><blockquote><p>"There‚Äôs no failing! FAIL is only your First Attempt In Learning"</p></blockquote><p><em>‚Äì Someone at SNConnect</em></p><p>See all my <strong>sketchnotes from SNConnect</strong> <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/snconnect20/">on this website</a> or in <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1309517283304243202">this twitter thread</a>.</p><h2>Discover new Sports</h2><p>Since January, I have had an Apple Watch. It was one of the best decisions to buy it. It really keeps me moving! Especially when I started working from home, I stopped exercising and moving. I had to find activities other than playing soccer. Activities that I could do by myself or with a few others.</p><p>My sister invited me to go <strong>rock climbing</strong> with her in May. I had some bouldering experience before, but I love climbing more because you're outside in the nature and it's so fun to spend time with my sister. We go almost every weekend!</p><p>In August, I started going <strong>swimming</strong> two to three times a week. During the summer, the outdoor pools were still open and I could go there after work. I could get my mind off work by riding my bike and going to swim. I was immediately hooked on it. I could do it by myself and enjoy the weather in the summer. I really enjoyed the 50m swim lane. I tried to crawl for a bit, but it just didn't work for me and I panicked after a few strokes, because I couldn't get enough air into my lungs. So, I just stuck to breaststroke and I was happy (when the swim lane was long enough and the lane was clear). On my vacation in September, the AirBnB had access to a spa at a hotel next door. They had a pool, but the swim lane was only ~13m long. So annoying, but hey, there was water and it was free üòâ One day, we went to a spa that had a loooong sports pool that was totally empty (of course) instead of the other hot tub and fun areas. I beat my highscore and swam 1km in under 20min! I was so happy the whole day.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I‚Äòve just swam 1km in under 20min for the first time since August. Yesss! üí™ <a href="https://t.co/efIDo5E0MD">pic.twitter.com/efIDo5E0MD</a></p>&mdash; diehimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1306553354953338881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>In October, I started a swimming course to learn crawl swimming. I was lucky, that the course was held in spite of Corona. They limited the number of participants from 10 to 5 and instead of 13 there were only 5 sessions. Training with so few others was a total win, our swim coach was able to give a lot more individual feedback. After each session I was so proud to do a little better than last time. In the very last session, I even got the nicest compliment from my swim coach, see <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1322298203841155072">my tweet</a>.</p><p>All in all, the swim was a complete success. I learned so much and I was able to overcome my fears with the front crawl.</p><p>Since November, all the pools have been closed due to lockdown. I really miss swimming and hope I don't have to relearn everything when they eventually reopen.</p><p>Since I can't go swimming right now, I bought a <strong>balance board</strong>. It's like a skateboard without wheels and you can do balance exercises with it in the living room in front of the TV. It's so simple but also really fun!</p><figure>

</figure><h2>iPad and Apple Pencil</h2><p>In August, I gave myself a birthday present: I ordered the iPad Pro 12.9" with the Apple Pencil. I wanted to use it for sketchnoting. A few weeks later, the <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1296048389629587457">Apple Pencil arrived</a>. Nice! I had to stay patient because the iPad took another two weeks to arrive. If you want to know why I bought it, what I was hoping for and how I liked it, I recommend reading my blog post <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/ipad-and-apple-pencil/">"Me, my new iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil"</a>.</p><h2>Vacation Mode On</h2><p>We were lucky with our vacation planning this year, so we managed to make a road trip to Austria in September without risking too much. It was great to explore the many lakes and hike in the mountains! We were able to go stand up paddling (I LOVE IT), canoeing, hiking and exploring. The pictures speak for themselves.</p><figure>

</figure><h2>Widget, Widget, Widget</h2><p>In September, the best <a href="https://twitter.com/xavierLowmiller">@xavierLowmiller</a> and me decided to experiment with the new iOS 14 feature - Widgets! We did some awesome pair programming sessions and after a while we were able to solve all the code signing issues. Widgets in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cineaste-app/id1402748020">Cineaste App</a> allow you to create a release countdown for your favorite movie that you would like to see. Unfortunately the cinemas were mostly closed this year, so only a few movies were released, but hopefully they will open again soon and it makes even more sense to use the widgets ü§û</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@felibe444</a> and I join the cool kids club and made a widget for her app, Cineaste!<br><br>Because anticipation is the best, you can now track the release date of upcoming movies!<br><br>Get it here:<a href="https://t.co/cFR91N5Reo">https://t.co/cFR91N5Reo</a> <a href="https://t.co/aKx8c8hJhx">pic.twitter.com/aKx8c8hJhx</a></p>&mdash; Xavier Lowmiller (@xavierLowmiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/xavierLowmiller/status/1311911949467254784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>Workshop for hundreds of People</h2><p>I knew that in November the NSSpain would take place. The schedule was announced day by day. I bought a ticket. At UIKonf, some people told me, that they would like a workshop on sketchnoting. But it was on such short notice that there was no way I could do it at UIKonf. But maybe I could do it now at NSSpain? Sometimes I'm in a yolo mood. So I just spontaneously messaged the organizer, Luis (<a href="https://twitter.com/Lascorbe">@Lascorbe</a>), on twitter. And he thought it was a great idea and managed to schedule me in, even though the schedule was already set. I'm still surprised that it worked out. Thanks again for the possibility, Luis!</p><p>I've already held a few workshops in my company last year. But they were always on-site workshops and in German, my native language. This time it would be virtual and in English! I was a bit freaked out. Two weeks later I managed to achieve a setup so that others could see the things I was drawing on my desk and also see me while I was speaking.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/thoughts-about-2020/workshop-setup.jpg" alt="On the left, you see a woman in with bunny ears and on the right you see hands on a desk,  a keyboard, a cup of tea and some other stuff from the top" />
    <figcaption>Professional video conference setup with my Macbook's video camera enabled (left) and screensharing the video from my iPhone held by a smartphone mount thingy (right).</figcaption>
</figure><p>This time the conference lasted 36 hours, so you could watch talks from all over the world and from every time zone. The conference would start on Thursday morning and end on Friday evening. My workshop would take place during the lunch break on Friday. I guessed that some people would see a few of my sketchnotes and maybe they would get interested and join my workshop. So it was the perfect time for the workshop.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Suuuuuper excited about my next workshop!

</code></pre><h2>My Highlights</h2><p>My highlights from this year are definitely that I discovered new sports activities. Climbing is really fun, you're out in the nature and #frankenjura has so much to offer. I also love that I get to spend time with my sister. Swimming in the summer was great, especially after work to clear my head. After a few weeks, I could see that I was gaining speed and endurance. I miss swimming a lot.</p><p>Definitely the workshop at NSSpain! I am so proud and happy that so many people participated and enjoyed it.</p><p>Most days this year, cooking was the highlight of the day for me. I started taking a picture of each lunch. Enjoy the video and I hope you don't get hungry watching it üòâüçΩ.</p><p>

I've always used pen and paper for it. As an iOS developer, I spend much of my time on my MacBook and my iPhone and somehow I wanted to hide from all the digital stuff. I also love to have one book with all sketchnotes, and to be able to browse through the book and remember everything easily.</p><img src="../../images/ipad-and-apple-pencil/header.jpg" alt="A sketchnote in a book and pencils next to it" /><h2>What has changed my opinion?</h2><p>The release of Scribble for iPad, in September 2020, really made me want to have an iPad with Apple Pencil again. It's always Apple and their really good marketing videos. They always get me. üôà</p><p><em>(For more about Scribble, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10106/">Meet Scribble for iPad</a> or my <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/sketchnotes/wwdc20-meet-scribble-for-ipad/">sketchnote about it</a>)</em></p><h2>What I have wished for...</h2><h3>First wish</h3><p>Sometimes, I'm <strong>having trouble to start projects</strong>, like sketchnotes, letterings or just drawing random things. I want to do it, but I'm afraid to waste paper because the result wouldn't look like I imagined it and I have to start over.</p><p>I know drawing and sketchnoting isn't about perfection and I have to learn a lot, so I shouldn't expect a perfect result from me. But this thought simply kept me from starting.</p><p>I wished that the iPad would help me with this. To start projects and to save paper.</p><h3>Second wish</h3><p>Another thing that I often have issues with, is <strong>dividing the space so that everything fits on one page</strong>. This is really difficult when you don't know what the talk is about in detail and you do a live sketchnote. Sometimes, I started to write too big for not so important information and had no place for the important things at the end.</p><p>Using an iPad would definitely help me with that because I could resize things or simply change the canvas size.</p><h3>Third wish</h3><p>There are <strong>a lot of manual steps to digitalize the paper sketchnote to an image</strong> which can then be shared on social media.</p><p>To share a sketchnote, I use Apples <em>Files</em> app to scan the sketchnote. Sadly, this always results in a <code>.pdf</code>, so I have to airdrop it to my MacBook and convert it to <code>.jpg</code> (or something else) because <code>.pdf</code> can't be posted on twitter. When converting the document, I always increase the distance to the edges, so the content has a bit more space. After the conversion and the editing, I can finally share the image on twitter.</p><p>Of course, using an iPad would help me with that because I can use the same device to edit, export and share the image.</p><h3>Fourth wish</h3><p>Of course, one of my goals is to improve my apps for the iPad, but for that, I have to first learn about "iPad patterns". Which kind of navigation should be used, a tab bar or a side bar? Should this be a detail view or a pop up? So, when I now use the iPad more often I want to have a detailed look at some existing apps and then to improve mine.</p><hr><p>So, one evening, I just ordered it. Sadly the order took four weeks. The Apple Pencil even arrived one week earlier, and I had two wait another week until I could finally use it. It was my deserved belated birthday present.</p><figure>

</figure><hr><h2>The "Get To Know" Phase</h2><p>Directly after unpacking and initial set up, I downloaded some of my favorite apps which I already use on my iPhone. My first additional purchase was the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/procreate/id425073498">Procreate</a> app. This is one of the most famous app for drawing with Apple Pencil support. The app is simple on the first glance, so it's easy to start with and you can instantly try out all the different brushes. But the app can also be a bit overwhelming because you can do soooo much!</p><p>Procreate has an awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlpSQCrjuGkoZHyUyO3cNEMyYPNkF0Hne">"Learn to Procreate" Playlist</a> in YouTube which are 2 to 3 minute videos explaining features of the app.</p><p><strong>Tip: To not be overwhelmed, try to only learn one feature in a week and not everything at once.</strong></p><p>It's so fun to browse through YouTube and peek into Procreate tutorials from amazing artists and try out new things. There are tons of Procreate tutorials in YouTube!</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/ipad-and-apple-pencil/procreate-overview.jpg" alt="A screenshot my projects in Procreate" />

</figure><h2>How do I like it now?</h2><p>After using the iPad for about six weeks now... I can say, it was a journey from being super excited at first, over overwhelmed, to pretty confident. It's definitely different to draw on an iPad than on paper, but you're getting used to it after some time. The <em>Paperlike</em> iPad Screen Protector helped me with this. It feels (and sounds) a lot more like drawing on paper.</p><p>iOS 14 was released and I could try out Scribble. I really like it because I don't have to put the pencil away to type something. But from time to time I find myself activating Scribble when I don't want to use it. Sometimes I start typing in "textfields" I haven't even seen, so I constantly rename my color palettes by mistake. Mh, maybe that's just me.</p><h3>Were my wishes fulfilled?</h3><ul><li>Help me with getting started. Check. ‚úÖ</li><li>Help me dividing space. Check. ‚úÖ</li><li>Help me digitalize the sketchnote. This one's easy, it's already digitalized. Check. ‚úÖ</li><li>Learn more about "iPad Patterns" and improve some apps (not really happened yet, but will do it some day!)</li></ul><p>Looks like the iPad was a total success for me, right?</p><p>The possibility to change and scale every element afterwards is a curse and a blessing at the same time. I've found out that after a live sketchnote, I still need another hour to revise the sketchnote so that I'm content with it.</p><p>The thought <strong>"It's good enough!"</strong> is now my new goal.</p><p>I've learned a lot at Sketchnote Connect 2020! My first sketchnoting conference ever! I've even submit a session about <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/sketchnotes/snconnect20-tips-and-tricks-for-sketchnoting-in-procreate/">"Tips and Tricks for Sketchnoting in ProCreate</a>, where I found out that others felt overwhelmed as well when they changed from analogue to digital sketchnoting!</p><figure>

Last week was <a href="https://appbuilders.ch/">AppBuilders</a> and this week was <a href="https://uikonf.com/">UIKonf</a>! The organizers of both conferences did an awesome job! Kudos to them! üëè</p><p>I love visiting conferences! But two days full of conference talks are hard! It's hard <strong>for your brain</strong> to stay focused and to process the things you've heard. It's hard <strong>for your back</strong> when you sit on your chair all the time, not only during the talks but also during the little breaks when you join sessions to meet others. It's hard <strong>for your fingers</strong> when you make sketchnotes two days long.</p><p>But to be honest, conferences are also exhausting when they are not online but you have to be on site (maybe even more). I always need some rest after a conference to process all the things I've experienced. <strong>Pro tip: take a day after the conference off if possible!</strong> Having a remote conference, a big advantage for sketchnoters is, that you have your own space for your pens, sketchbooks and stuff and you don't have to make sketchnotes on your knees. This was really nice! üôÉ</p><figure style="max-width:500px">

    <figcaption>A small behind the scenes with me and my new UIKonf shirt.</figcaption>
</figure><h2>Sketchnote all the talks! Why would I do that?</h2><p>Watching talks from home, makes it easier to get distracted ‚Äì at least for me! Nobody will see (and blaim) you, when you open a tab in your browser and scroll through twitter... or when you grab your phone and answer some messages.</p><p><strong>Sketchnoting helps to stay focused on the talk.</strong> The brain is busy. Busy listening to the speaker and filtering things out if they are important or not so much. The hand is busy. Busy drawing some little sketches or writing down an important quote of the speaker.</p><p>After around 10 talks, it will be hard to stay focused even when you make sketchnotes. But it's ok. Everybody feels like this (I think üòÖ). After the first day, one of my fingers started to hurt so much while holding a pen, I actually had to tape it (this is #veryHardWork üòú).</p><p><strong>You honor the speakers.</strong> All speakers have invested a lot of work into their preparation of the talk and their presentation. None of my sketchnotes would exist without them! Always tag and reference the speaker in your posts, so they get notified and others can easily find more content of the speaker.</p><p><strong>It's a great summary.</strong> I use my sketchnotes as a summary for what happened in the talk. On conferences, other participants often want to know what your favorite talk was. It may happen that you don't even know what to answer because it happened <em>so much</em> during the day, that you forgot everything. A small look into my book helps me quickly and every talk is present again in front of my inner eye and I'm a bit more able to answer the question. Also, people who didn't take part in the conference can get an impression what happened in the talk and can decide if they want to watch the video or not.</p><p><strong>It's a lot of fun.</strong> I love sketchnoting! I use pen and paper for it and since I've started with sketchnoting in November 2018, I've already finished two sketchbooks which are full of sketchnotes. I love to riffle through the books and see how my style has evolved and remind me of the talks, meetups and conferences I've visited the last years. You can see a big difference between the style of my notes <a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/uikonf/">from UIKonf 2019 and UIKonf 2020</a> (There are 12 months in between!).</p><h2>Tips and tricks?</h2><p>I've invested some time into <strong>preparation</strong>. Before the conference started, I wrote all talk titles, speaker names and their twitter handles on my notes, as well as the conference name and my twitter handle.</p><img src="../../images/sketchnotes-on-online-conferences/sketchnote-preparation.jpg" alt="Sketchnote header, conference and credits signature are highlighted on the sketchnote." /><p>This <strong>saved me a lot of time</strong> during the actual conference. Between the talks is mostly not much time and all I had to do was to wait for the next talk to begin and start by adding the content.</p><hr><p>ü§© I'm so happy when other people like my sketchnotes and tell me that they actually find them useful! It makes everything much more worth!</p><p>Even though, nothing would ever stop me from making sketchnotes and nothing should ever stop you üòâ</p><h2>Links to...</h2><h3>#AppBuilders20</h3><ul><li><a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/appbuilders20/">AppBuilders 2020 sketchnotes</a> on this website</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1259807545364971520">Twitter thread</a> with my sketchnotes</li><li><a href="https://2020.appbuilders.ch/memento">Memento page</a> with links to talks in YouTube</li></ul><h3>#UIKonf2020</h3><ul><li><a href="https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/uikonf20/">UIKonf 2020 sketchnotes</a> on this website</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1262396003413643269">Twitter thread</a> with my sketchnotes</li><li>Talks are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdr22uU_wISpu7T6JWq7eMSxP0tYcmXcB">available on YouTube</a> since June</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/welcome-sketchnotes</guid><title>Welcome, Sketchnotes!</title><description>When I released my website in January 2020, I was a hundred percent sure, that I wanted to add my sketchnotes in it as well... but I needed more time to think about how to implement it and I was also unsure about how the layout and navigation should look like.</description><link>https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/welcome-sketchnotes</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Welcome, Sketchnotes!</h1><p>Some years ago, a friend of me asked why I don't have my own website where I could host my content. To this time, I was mostly active on Instagram where I posted my photographs and on Twitter to post some things every now and then. To have my own website was something I've never thought of before. Why should I invest time to create a website, when mostly everyone uses platforms like Instagram or Twitter to consume content on a daily basis?</p><p>But after this conversation the first seed was planted. The more I thought about it, the more I've realised that I could have full control over the content I post on my website. I won't stop posting things on other platforms, but now I can refer to my website when I share content. Besides, it feels so <strong>awesome to have my own little place</strong> in the big world of internet, where everything which matters to me can be discovered. A place with things I've created and am proud of.</p><p>When I released this website in January 2020, I was a hundred percent sure, that I wanted to display my sketchnotes as well... but I needed more time to think about how to implement it and I was also unsure about how the layout and navigation should look like.</p><p>But three months later, I had a plan!</p><h2>What was the plan? Which things needed to be done?</h2><h3>1) Navigation to access the sections</h3><p>I needed a navigation bar to access the new section. That was one of the easier things, because I've already had some example in mind, which I could get inspired by.</p><p>It's a simple white rectangle with (currently) two sections "Posts" and "Sketchnotes". When you hover over one of the elements, you see a line under the text. This looks the same when the section is selected.</p><img src="../../images/welcome-sketchnotes/navigation-bar-hover.jpg" alt="Screenshot of hover State of Navigation Bar with underlined section" /><h3>2) Preview of recent sketchnotes</h3><p>On the first page of my website, you see the most recent items. I wanted to add my latest sketchnotes to this page. This is only a small part from the content of page <code>/sketchnotes</code> with the same design. So, let's jump directly to the list of all sketchnotes.</p><h3>3) List of all sketchnotes</h3><p>The page <code>/sketchnotes</code> should give an overview of all my sketchnotes. You should see a list of all sketchnotes which are displayed with smaller images as thumbnails.</p><img src="../../images/welcome-sketchnotes/sketchnote-list.jpg" alt="Screenshot of page with list of skecthnote" /><p>To have a website which is <strong>performant and loads its content quickly</strong> without using your whole monthly mobile data, was very important to me.</p><p>Google gives a nice insight on why optimizing images is so important:</p><blockquote><p>Images often account for most of the downloaded bytes on a page. As a result, optimizing images can often yield some of the largest byte savings and performance improvements: the fewer bytes the browser has to download, the less competition there is for the client's bandwidth and the faster the browser can download and render content on the screen.</p></blockquote><p>(<em>see the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeImages">article: Optimize Images</a></em>)</p><p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/die-himmelstraeumerin-blog/blob/master/create-thumbnails.sh">script</a> to easily generate thumbnails for the list. The script uses the power of <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to resize all images and to save the resized image as new file with a suffix <code>-small</code>. It has already saved me tons of hours with resizing images!</p><p>Creating the layout for the list was a challenge for me. Every sketchnote has <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> and they exist in <strong>both orientations</strong>, landscape and portrait. I wanted to display the latest sketchnotes on top of the screen, to be able to scroll down and see how the sketchnotes developed. Additionally, I wanted a <strong>CSS only solution</strong>, because I like to keep it simple whenever it's possible.</p><p>I'm a newbie when it comes to HTML and CSS, so I had to learn a lot about different HTML layout techniques. There are many different tutorials for photo grid layouts out there and I've tried different kinds, like CSS grid, flexbox and finally used a column layout, which worked best for me.</p><p>In the next image there are four layout variations. In each variation the numbers from 1 to 12 display the creation date of a sketchnote from new to old, which means sketchnote 1 is the latest and sketchnote 12 is the oldest. The blue lines display which side should have the same length for every image. I don't want to crop the sketchnotes in preview and images shouldn't be distorted (who would ever want this?!), one side ‚Äì either height or width ‚Äì needs to have a fix length for all images.</p><img src="../../images/welcome-sketchnotes/html-layout.jpg" alt="Four possible list layouts" /><ul><li>(1) is what I actually wanted to achieve</li><li>(2) is what I was able to achieve with <strong>grid layout</strong></li><li>(3) is what I was able to achieve with <strong>flexbox</strong></li><li>(4) is what I was able to achieve with <strong>column layout</strong></li></ul><p>Layout 4 is nearly the same as Layout 1 and is therefore <em>nearly perfect</em>. Only the order of the images isn't like I wanted. Nevertheless, I chose this layout to be the final one (for the moment).</p><p><em>EDIT: in November 2020, I changed the layout to flexbox layout for various reasons (<a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/die-himmelstraeumerin-blog/commit/e24c8f958bcc5e34dfff9850dd13bf380a08b44d">see commit</a>):</em></p><blockquote><p>1) To fix order of sketchnotes in <code>/sketchnotes</code>. The items are now displayed from top left to bottom right. To make this possible, every sketchnote has the same aspect ratio and is filled up with white space. 2) To remove weird visual effect when refreshing <code>/sketchnotes</code>. 3) To remove a bug with shadow and link in column-layout.</p></blockquote><h3>4) Detail of sketchnote</h3><p>To layout the detail page of a sketchnote was easier to achieve than the list. The page consists of different elements, mainly one big image. As some sketchnotes are too high to see them complete directly without scrolling, I added a link on the image to open it in a new tab in full resolution. In the new tab, the browser navigation features can be used to zoom in and out.</p><img src="../../images/welcome-sketchnotes/sketchnote-detail.jpg" alt="Screenshot of detail page of skecthnote" /><p>The static HTML for this website is generated with <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a>. To have as less manual work as possible when adding a new sketchnote, most of the HTML for the detail page is generated. This means, I add the content for the page in a markdown file, add some logic how the HTML should look like and Publish generates the HTML from the mix of content and logic.</p><p>A markdown file for a sketchnote detail page looks something like this:</p><pre><code>---
date: <span class="number">2020</span>-<span class="number">03</span>-<span class="number">28 20</span>:<span class="number">50</span>
description: <span class="type">Sketchnote</span> about <span class="type">XYZ</span>
tags: sketchnote, xyz
image: images/sketchnotes/sketchnote-xyz-small.<span class="property">jpg</span>
---

## <span class="type">Sketchnote XYZ</span>
</code></pre><p>I manually add information about:</p><ul><li>the <strong>date</strong>, when I created the sketchnote, which is used to sort the list of sketchnotes</li><li>the <strong>description</strong>, which is also used as alt tag for the sketchnote</li><li><strong>tags</strong>, which can be used to find other sketchnotes</li><li>the <strong>path to the thumbnail image</strong>*</li><li>the <strong>title</strong>, which can't be generated from the image name</li></ul><p>*I remove the part <code>-small</code> from the thumbnail image path to get the path to the original image and add a HTML structure around the full size image. This is done once in code and doesn't have to be adapted for other sketchnotes.</p><h2>How do I add a new sketchnote?</h2><ol><li>First of all, I add the sketchnote image with a "good" naming to the <code>/Resources/images/sketchnotes/</code> folder. The naming is important because the name will also be used for the URL for the detail page.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>If the image isn't of type <code>.jpg</code>, I can run a script to convert <code>.png</code> to <code>.jpg</code> by running <code>make convert-png</code>. All tasks are defined in a <a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/die-himmelstraeumerin-blog/blob/master/Makefile"><code>Makefile</code></a>, which was added to demonstrate which tasks can be run in the project and to easily run these tasks.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>The thumbnails for the list have to be created. Therefore I run the script, I've mentioned earlier, by running <code>make thumbs</code>.</li></ol><ol start="4"><li>I create a markdown file, where information about the content is added manually. I copy an existing file most of the time and name it like the image.*</li></ol><ol start="5"><li>Run <code>make</code> to generate the new HTML code.</li></ol><p>*<em>EDIT: in November 2020, I added a script to generate markdown files with correct naming for all sketchnote images. This makes it even more easier. (<a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/die-himmelstraeumerin-blog/commit/402382440f77757be574ac55b2a11445b3780bd3">see commit</a>)</em></p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>I have thousand ideas what to do next and what to improve. My top three are:</p><ul><li>I think about adding the <strong>name of the speaker or author</strong>, because none of these sketchnotes could be created without a speaker or an author and I want to honor them. <em>(EDIT: done in this <a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/die-himmelstraeumerin-blog/commit/5f7d08c03cc3837bb87af2cb9c4875f4fd1cc4c3">commit</a>)</em></li><li>To display a bit more information about a sketchnote in the list, I want to <strong>display the title on hover</strong>. <em>(EDIT: done in this <a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/die-himmelstraeumerin-blog/commit/afdb98b2ea1d89cfc09f072611c776f5045d54fe">commit</a>)</em></li><li>It would be great to <strong>improve dark mode for sketchnotes</strong>.

I only used Travis for running tests or linter, nothing too complicated.</description><link>https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/github-actions</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Migration from Travis CI to GitHub Actions</h1><p>The last days, I migrated some of my open source repositories from <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> to <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.</p><p>I only used Travis for running tests or linter, nothing too complicated.</p><h2>Running Tests in iOS Repositories</h2><p>Most of my <code>.travis.yml</code> files looked similar to the code snippet below. I want to run two commands in the CI (with fastlane):</p><ul><li><code>bundle exec fastlane test</code></li><li><code>bundle exec fastlane snapshot_test</code></li></ul><pre><code>language: swift
osx_image: xcode11.<span class="number">2</span>
cache:
  - bundler
install:
  - bundle install
  - pod install --repo-update

jobs:
  include:
    - script: bundle exec fastlane test
      name: <span class="type">Unit Tests</span>
    - script: bundle exec fastlane snapshot_test
      name: <span class="type">Snapshot Tests</span>
</code></pre><p>The first lines are setup code, like specifying the Xcode version or which dependencies have to be installed.</p><h3>How to migrate to GitHub Actions?</h3><p>There are two steps for this:</p><ol><li>Add Workflow</li><li>Delete <code>.travis.yml</code></li></ol><h4>1. Add Workflow</h4><p>To migrate this to GitHub Actions, I started with tapping on the "Actions" tap in the repository.</p><img src="../../images/github-actions/github-actions-tab.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the tabs in a repository of GitHub, where "Actions" is highlighted." /><p>It will create a new file for you <code>.github/workflows/&lt;name&gt;.yml</code> with a editor. On the left there is a preview of the most important documentations to understand the syntax and a link to featured marketplace actions.</p><img src="../../images/github-actions/github-actions-editor.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub Actions editor." /><p>This editor is helpful (sometimes), because it checks for valid syntax, but it can also be a pain. When you want to add a new line between existing code there are some autocompletion actions and it adds some syntax for you. I'm always suprised when this happens.</p><p>The following code snippet shows what you have to define when you want to have the same functionality from the Travis setup.</p><pre><code>name: <span class="type">CI</span>

    branches:
    - master

</code></pre><p>Sadly there is nothing like a <code>install</code> phase (yet?), which I know from Travis or Gitlab CI. So, there is some duplicated code in here for installing the dependencies for each job. But there is a solution for it. You can create a "Install Dependency" job and the other jobs then wait for this to finish but I didn't try it out yet. I found this in the <a href="https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/the-same-dependency-in-all-workflows-jobs/td-p/37266">GitHub Community Forum</a> where I discovered some useful hints and tips.</p><h4>2. Delete <code>.travis.yml</code></h4><p>And when you have added the jobs in the new file, you can delete your <code>.travis.yml</code> file and you are already finished. I highly recommend to try this out in a branch üòâ</p><h3>Benefits from GitHub Actions</h3><h4>All jobs are visible</h4><p>When you add a new pull request for the migration, you'll see, that all jobs are directly displayed in the pull request.</p><img src="../../images/github-actions/checks.jpg" alt="Two screenshots, one where you can only see one check (from Travis CI) and one where you can see three checks which ran with GitHub Actions." /><h4>Speed</h4><p>When using Travis CI, the jobs had to be in queue for some time before they started, like 5 to 10 minutes. This seems to happen instantly with GitHub Actions, I didn't wait for 30 seconds to see that the jobs have already started. So, instead of waiting ~12 minutes for all jobs to finish with Travis CI, I now wait ~4 minutes. This is such a huge difference!</p><h4>Marketplace</h4><p>There is a ton of community work available to use. You can browse through the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">marketplace</a> and you can imagine to automate everything, you could ever think of. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but this was my first impression.</p><p>There is a repository called "<a href="https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions">Awesome Actions</a>" where some (obviously) awesome actions are collected.</p><h4>MacStadium</h4><p>When running jobs with <code>macos-latest</code>, GitHub uses <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/">MacStadium</a> to host the macOS runners as stated in their <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners">documentation</a>. This also saves some time when there is no waiting time for starting virtual machines.</p><h2>Additions</h2><h3>Run CI from forks</h3><p>When you use the "Actions" tab to create a new workflow the default for the trigger is <code>on: [push]</code>. I thought, this is perfect for my use cases, but when someone forked the repository and creates a pull request, no CI is running automatically. So, I used <code>on: [push, pull_request]</code> as trigger, but then the jobs are running twice when creating a pull request. The solution is this:</p><pre><code>on:
push:
  branches:
  - master
pull_request:
  branches:
  - master
</code></pre><p>Found in the <a href="https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/How-to-trigger-an-action-on-push-or-pull-request-but-not-both/td-p/35805">GitHub Community Forum</a></p><h3>Pin Xcode Version</h3><p>It's also possible to pin the Xcode version. Add the following code above <code>jobs</code>.</p><pre><code>env:
  <span class="type">DEVELOPER_DIR</span>: /<span class="type">Applications</span>/<span class="type">Xcode_11</span>.<span class="number">3</span>.<span class="property">app</span>/<span class="type">Contents</span>/<span class="type">Developer</span>
</code></pre><p>Found in the <a href="https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Selecting-an-Xcode-version/m-p/32340#M1092">GitHub Community Forum</a></p><h3>Pin macOS version</h3><p>Currently, it's only possible to use the <code>macos_latest</code> tag to specify that you need a Mac to run your jobs. The tag currently specifies to use <code>macOS 10.15</code>. When you have to use another macOS version, it's not possible to specify an explicit version. But maybe the solution for this is to use <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-self-hosted-runners">self-hosted runners</a> which sounds interesting, but also a bit overhead for these simple tasks which I need the CI for.</p><hr><p>Migrations from repositories:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/pull/131">PR ‚Äì Cineaste App (iOS)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/fbernutz/mood-tracker-android/pull/2">PR ‚Äì Mood Tracker (Android)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/criticalmaps/criticalmaps-ios/pull/219">PR ‚Äì CriticalMaps (iOS)</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/thoughts-about-2019</guid><title>Thoughts about 2019</title><description>"If you loved it, you should write a blog post on it."

I learned a ton and I tried to be more present in the internet because I've learned sharing is caring. I think, even when nobody's reading this, it's worth it, because it's a good summary for me and it helps me to think about my experiences. This year I've read through my tweets to discover which topics concerned me the most.</p><h2>Accessibility</h2><p><em>(01/2019 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>My interest in accessibility started after I saw my mom using a smartphone for her first time in March. I've read somewhere that you can only be really motivated about fixing accessibility issues if you know someone who is affected, if you can feel empathy for someone ‚Äì I think this is true. Sadly. Sadly, because we all are getting older and if we build products, which are accessible, we are building them for our future selves. I think, there is simply no excuse for not building apps accessible <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1106682450778959874?s=20">(see my tweet)</a>.</p><p>I learned more and more about different aspects of accessibility, like accessibility specific for iOS apps but also inclusion in general... and I still learn every day! I want to spread awareness, that <strong>accessibility is not just a nice-to-have</strong>, it's a must! It should be as self-evident to build products accessible as writing unit tests. So, I held a talk about it at our clients' office where I gave my best to change the mindset about who needs an accessible app and how important it is to build an app for everyone. The main target group of this talk was people from our business and lead team. See my slides about it on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/fbernutz/building-apps-for-everyone">speakerdeck</a>.</p><p>I received great feedback. Some of the attendees didn‚Äôt even know about the accessibility features in iOS and they found it really important to learn about this topic. So, I put my words into my very first blog post to reach one or two more people. I was (and still am) so proud!</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is Global Accessibility Awareness Day <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAAD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GAAD</a>. It‚Äôs therefore a perfect time to release my first blog post about why you should build apps for everyone. <a href="https://t.co/GcJNbGyZfd">https://t.co/GcJNbGyZfd</a>

Every day in December they've published an article about accessibility with very diverse topics. What I loved most about it, that I could discover so many new people who are accessibility lovers. It's so good to see that there are actually many people out there, who also want to spread awareness and who share their experiences!</p><h2>Cineaste App</h2><p><em>(01/2019 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>For those who don't know about my relationship to this app. I'm a contributer on <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios">GitHub</a> and I love working on it, because I can decide on which features I'm working next or just try out some iOS features, which I always wanted to learn.</p><p>I had the plan to update the layout for all screens for a long time and on the beginning of this year, I could finally implement the new designs. I like it much better now and it was so much fun to design screens on my own. See these pull requests with some screenshots for the difference: <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/pull/74">Update Search View #74</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/pull/82">Update Movie Detail Layout #82</a></p><p>When I implemented the layout changes, I also made everything work with <strong>Dynamic Type and Voice Over</strong>. Surprisingly, it took me only half a day to make the layout work completely without any warnings on small and on large devices with small and large fonts. So, I've learned, it's better to do it correct one time, instead of having problems with different device sizes every time!</p><blockquote class=" twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Took me nearly half a day, but I built the new search layout in Cineaste to *truly* support dynamic type ‚Äì without any constraint warnings or broken layouts on a small iPhone 5 with iOS 10 as well as on an iPhone X with iOS 12 with small and extra large system fonts!

</blockquote><p>We tested the iOS App on an event called <a href="https://usability-testessen.org/">"Usability Test-Essen"</a>. This event takes part in many cities in Germany. On one evening, a handful of testers test your product with some scenarios you give them. It was very interesting to see what was easy to understand for the tester and what they didn't even discover. It was an exhausting but amazing experience! I highly recommend to test your own product but also to test other products.</p><blockquote class=" twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">

</blockquote><p>With the release of iOS 13 in autumn there came a lot new features. Mainly interesting for the user ‚Äì <strong>Dark Mode</strong>! Actually, I feared implementing it, because I had no plan how a dark design of Cineaste should look like and it looked like a lot of work... So, I disabled Dark Mode for iOS 13 in the first step. After a few months, I decided to go for it again. Even Instagram had its own dark mode, so I can do it as well. I started to make a design first, to have a plan for the implementation and to think about how it could look like. It was way easier than I thought it would be and it looked kinda good. I got super motivated when I had a screenshot of the new design on my phone. I wanted to start implementing it right away. It only took me two evening/nights to implement the new design. To be able to test the implemented dark mode on my device, was such a great feeling. I wonder why I feared starting with it at all. I looove the new dark mode üòç</p><p>See my <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1189439995716816897?s=20">tweets</a> about it and the <a href="https://github.com/spacepandas/cineaste-ios/pull/114">pull request</a> with some screenshots, if you are interested how it was implemented.</p><h2>Sketchnoting</h2><p><em>(11/2018 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>Sketchnoting came into my life in November 2018. I was at <a href="https://dachfest.com/">DACHFest</a> and took part in a sketchnoting workshop with <a href="https://twitter.com/lariki">@lariki</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MiBLT">@MiBLTl</a>. DACHFest was the first conference where I tried to sketchnote every talk. I found out quickly how much it helped me to stay concentrated during the presentations. I also liked the aspect to have easy reminders for every talk. Sketchnotes are perfect for recaps after a conference.<br><br>I visited AppBuilders in April in Lugano, CH <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1126075162032525312">(AppBuilders Twitter Thread)</a> and UIKonf in May in Berlin, GER <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1134143368706088960">(UIKonf Twitter Thread)</a> and sketchnoted all talks...</p><p>What can I say, <strong>I love doing sketchnotes</strong>.</p><p>After three conferences full of talks (so about 30 sketchnotes) you could see some progress, how the notes got better and better (visually). This is a pure subjective impression but they looked more like something which really should look like it looks and not some kind of random output.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">

</blockquote><p>I talked a lot about sketchnoting at work too and especially in WWDC season, of course, I did sketchnotes of the sessions I've watched and showed them to my colleagues üòâ I think, it was just a matter of time, when a colleague suggested that I should do a workshop about sketchnoting at my company. I immediately declined, because I was just a beginner myself! But one day later, I said that I want to do it. Because... sharing is caring! So, I prepared my very first workshop <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1159192552228163584?s=20">(see tweet)</a>. I was so scared but also excited, because sketchnoting is simply my favorite. I'm so glad, that I got so much support at my company!</p><p>I was overwhelmed by my feeling after I did my first workshop in August.

</blockquote><p>In August/September, I made one sketchnote of every day of my vacation, even though I never was a diary writer. Especially on vacation, I often have the feeling I'm overwhelmed of all the impressions that I forget what I experienced over the day. Sketchnotes help me to think about what happened and to calm down after a long day. If you are interested how a sketchnote of vacations can look like, you can watch a small video of my sketchnotes <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1172838391836303360">in this tweet</a>.</p><p>I also had my first sketchnoting "job". I was asked to make sketchnotes for my company at the "Agile Leadership" conference in October in Nuremberg. Why not giving it a try, if some of the sketchnotes are worth sharing, we could share it with the companys twitter account. The topic of the conference was nothing iOS related, so I felt a bit uncomfortable with sketchnoting about something with so many abstract words... How could you do a sketch about "agile transformations"?! Mh, but I was ready for this challenge and you can see the sketchnotes in this <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1179095476731351040">thread</a>. What I loved most, was that sketchnoting was an ice breaker at this conference. Some people talked to me just because they saw me taking notes and asked me questions about it.</p><p>In the second and third workshop about sketchnoting in my company in October and December I could try out different workshop elements like some new sketching excercises, like sketching your neighbour with your eyes closed. This was so fun and with these little challenges it felt a lot more like a workshop instead of a talk. See my tweets of the <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1182651589682749440?s=20">second</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1203015570175729669">third</a> workshop.</p><h2>A Project In Two Years</h2><p><em>(01/2018 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>I am now in the same project at my company for two years.

</blockquote><p>I discovered the iOS repository for the Critical Mass, called <a href="https://github.com/criticalmaps/criticalmaps-ios">Critical Maps</a>. It has about 80 stars in GitHub which is a very good number for an app. It was fun to contribute to the project and to receive feedback from the other contributers. One of the main contributers invited me to join their organization. Now, I can also review pull requests and merge them and discuss in their slack channel which was a pretty big deal for me, because there were a lot people I didn't know. I love that they are so open for new contributers, it's so fun to work with others in open source and I'm looking forward to work with them.</p><h2>Advent Of Code</h2><p><em>(12/2019)</em></p><p>In December, I asked some colleagues if they were interested in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/about">Advent Of Code</a> challenges and there were some people who were brave enough to try it.

</blockquote><p>Day after day the challenges got more complex and it took way more time to solve them... Day ten was the first day, where I couldn't complete both puzzles on the same day. It was the start of losing interest.</p><p>Even though I didn't complete all puzzles (didn't even try the last days üôà), I learned so much about Swift and that I shouldn't give up until I've at least tried. Even though these kind of programming puzzles are hard for me, I can do it!</p><h2>Annual Commit Report</h2><p><em>(01/2019 - 12/2019)</em></p><p>It's a tradition to analyze your annual commit history at the end of December.

But in reality, we all find tons of excuses for not going that extra mile ‚Ä¶</p><p>When you add new features to your app, nobody will test accessibility features (I really hope there are some exceptions out there). You don‚Äôt even get the time and money to implement these features. So, at some point, you as a developer, simply don‚Äôt think about it anymore.</p><hr><h2>A few weeks ago, I had a key experience.</h2><p>My mom is visually and motor impaired and she got her <em>first</em> smartphone (Hallo Mama üëã). I never even imagined that this could be a thing for her, but one day, she just called a friend and went out to buy a used Android smartphone. She asked me for help to set everything up, install some apps, and explain some things here and there.</p><p>I observed closely how she interacted with her new phone. It was nearly impossible for her to type in her personal information to create a Google account, because her fine motor skills were too weak. The difficulties she had using the smartphone really blew my mind.</p><p>The first thing we did, was to scale up the system font size, and we realized that even the Android system itself is not fully optimized for accessibility.</p><figure>
    <img  src="../../images/building-apps-for-everyone/example.jpg"  alt="Screenshot of an Android Smartphone where the font size is enlarged and half of the text is not readable because it's trimmed">
    <figcaption>Screenshot of an Android Smartphone where the font size is enlarged and half of the text is not readable because it's trimmed</figcaption>
</figure><p>One might think that increasing the system font size that much is a rare use case. And some people might even say, that this would only be relevant for less than about 5% of their product‚Äôs target group. It would not be worth the money to build something only for these few people, so they can be ignored! Right?</p><p>Ehh‚Ä¶ No.</p><h2>Who actually needs accessibility features?</h2><p>First, everybody thinks of <strong>permanently</strong> disabled people, like people with only one arm, and blind or deaf people.</p><p>But there are also <strong>temporarily</strong> disabled people, like someone who has a broken arm and can only use one hand to operate a smartphone.</p><p>People move in different environments. So, there are also <strong>situational</strong> disabilities. When you are a new parent, you carry your baby on your arm all the time. Therefore you suddenly just have one hand to use your smartphone. Abilities can change dramatically, depending on the environment you are in.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúAccessibility is not just about making information available to users with disabilities ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making information available to everyone, regardless of their capabilities or situation.‚Äù ‚Äî Apple</p></blockquote><figure>

    <figcaption>Microsoft uses the "<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/">Persona Spectrum</a>" to help foster empathy.</figcaption>
</figure><h2>Which tools does Apple offer to help?</h2><p>Apple is really good in supporting users with accessibility features. But Android is also not that bad with Google Assistant (and all the features, like Live Caption, Live Relay, and Live Transcribe they have recently announced at Google I/O). As I am an iOS developer, I will only focus on some features which are available on iOS.</p><h3>Voice Over</h3><blockquote><p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to see your iPhone to use your iPhone.‚Äù ‚Äî Apple</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/de/accessibility/iphone/vision/">Voice Over</a> is a gesture-based screen reader. You can navigate through elements on the screen by swiping to the right to focus the next element.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/building-apps-for-everyone/voice-over.jpg" alt="A screenshot of an app where a cell is selected by voice over and a speech bubble with the text which is read by voice over." />
    <figcaption>Voice Over reads content aloud, like ‚ÄúThe Hustle, 6.5 of 10, released on May 10, 2019‚Äù.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Normally, the position and the spacing between elements like text and images connects the content, but visually impaired users can‚Äôt see this. The <strong>content should be bundled semantically</strong>, so it‚Äôs read aloud together and will be focused as one element.</p><h3>Reading Support</h3><blockquote><p>‚ÄúYou see it. iPhone says it.‚Äù ‚Äî Apple</p></blockquote><p>Turn on <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/learning/">Speak Screen</a> and swipe down from the top of the screen with two fingers, or just tell Siri to Speak Screen, to have all the content on pages read back to you.</p><p>You can also select text to be read aloud for you with a ‚ÄúSpeak‚Äù button. This is extremely useful for people who find it easier to listen to a voice rather than read a text.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/building-apps-for-everyone/speak.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the popover which appears when you select text and where you can activate "Speak" to read out aloud the selected text." />
    <figcaption>With Reading Support, text can be read aloud for you.</figcaption>
</figure><h3>Dynamic Type</h3><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/">Dynamic Type</a> converts the text size to a larger (or smaller) size. It‚Äôs a systemwide setting, so every third-party app should support it.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/building-apps-for-everyone/text-size.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the popover which appears when you select text and where you can activate "Speak" to read out aloud the selected text." />
    <figcaption>One quarter of <a href="https://pdfviewer.io/">PDF Viewer Pro</a> users don‚Äôt use the default system font size. <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1053253245810958336">https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1053253245810958336</a></figcaption>
</figure><p>These are some statistics about which font size users of PDF Viewer Pro use. It‚Äôs interesting to see how many people don‚Äôt use the default system font size (L) in iOS ‚Äî nearly <strong>one quarter</strong>.</p><p>While these statistics can be a good validation whether to support dynamic type or not, it should be supported because it‚Äôs simply <strong>the right thing</strong> to do.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">While these stats are a good validation, not sure I need them to support accessibility features.<br><br>Support dynamic type because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. People who use accessibility settings expect them to be consistent every where, the app sticks out if it doesn‚Äôt support them <a href="https://t.co/XqLa3UDApn">https://t.co/XqLa3UDApn</a></p>

</blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>Further Tools</h2><h3>Reachability</h3><p>On large iPhones (larger than 4"), you can move the page to the lower half of the device with a double tap (not click) on the Home button, so you <strong>easily reach elements at the top of the screen</strong>. On devices without a Home button, it can be activated with a swipe down gesture in the Home bar at the bottom.</p><h3>Display Settings</h3><p>‚Ä¶like <em>Zoom, Magnifier, Invert Colours, Colour Filters, Increase Contrast, and Bold Text</em>.</p><h3>Reduce Motion</h3><p>Some people suffer from motion sickness, therefore it is important to reduce animations and motions in your app when a user has enabled <em>Reduce Motion</em>.</p><h3>Switch Control</h3><p>Even if you can‚Äôt move from the neck down, you can fully control your phone.</p><figure>

</figure><h2>Conclusion ‚Äî Why should we build accessible apps?</h2><h3>‚Ä¶ because users expect that it just works everywhere</h3><p>Affected users expect accessibility features to work in every app. If they don‚Äôt, an app will be noticed negatively.</p><h3>‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs cheaper when you do it right away</h3><p>When you focus on implementing accessibility features during the development process of new features, it will be much cheaper than doing it afterwards.</p><p>Designers and developers can pay attention to some things that will make it easier to support accessibility.</p><ul><li>Prefer to <strong>put elements underneath each other</strong> instead of side by side, so they will scale much more easily.</li><li><strong>Never use fixed heights</strong> for elements!</li><li><strong>Prefer system elements</strong> over custom ones, because most accessibility features are already working for the system ones.</li></ul><p>When you have an idea about how a screen should look like with a large font size before the implementation of the feature starts, it will be much easier to implement it directly the correct way.</p><h3>‚Ä¶ because it can improve the design for all users</h3><p>The design of a screen is often much simpler and more focused when you design it with accessibility in mind, so it will improve the design for all users, even those who are not disabled.</p><h3>‚Ä¶ because it improves the code</h3><p>Apps which support Dynamic Type are often built correctly, so these apps have fewer issues with different device sizes.</p><h3>‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs simply the right thing</h3><p>It should be everybody‚Äôs goal to include people with different abilities. So, let‚Äôs remind ourselves about that in our daily work. Test your app with accessibility features enabled and tell your development team about issues. Your users will be grateful.</p><hr><blockquote><p>‚ÄúIf we use our own abilities as a baseline, we make things that are easy for some people to use, but difficult for everyone else.‚Äù ‚Äî Microsoft</p></blockquote><figure>

</figure><hr><h3>About this post</h3><p><em>Two weeks ago, I gave a presentation about this topic at our client‚Äôs workspace with the goal to change the mindset about who needs an app that supports accessibility features, and how important it is to build an app for everyone. The main target group of this talk was people from our business and lead team. I received great feedback. Some of the attendees didn‚Äôt even know about these features and they found it really important to learn about this topic. So, I put my words into this blog post to reach one or two more people (and to remember the points I was talking about).</em></p><p><em>You can find my slides from the talk here: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/fbernutz/building-apps-for-everyone">https://speakerdeck.com/fbernutz/building-apps-for-everyone</a></em></p><h3>Additional Links</h3><p><em>The following resources were used for the quotes in this blog post and are a good starting point to get more information about Accessibility and Inclusive Design.
