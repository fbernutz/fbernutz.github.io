														</h1>
														<p>One year ago, I wrote down the most important things for me from 2019. I really liked it, because it helped me to process the year and to remember what happened. Obviously, 2020 is marked by the pandemic. I wish so badly that this will be over soon! A few days ago, I watched "Soul" and it reminded me not to wait for something but to enjoy the little things. So, I need to write this down to remember myself that not everything was bad and that I've learned and experienced a lot.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>Since 2018, I make sketchnotes of conference talks and lots of other things. I've always used pen and paper for it. As an iOS developer, I spend much of my time on my MacBook and my iPhone and somehow I wanted to hide from all the digital stuff. I also love to have one book with all sketchnotes, and to be able to browse through the book and remember everything easily.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>I love visiting conferences! But two days full of conference talks are hard! It's hard for your brain to stay focused and to process the things you've heard. It's hard for your back when you sit on your chair all the time, not only during the talks but also during the little breaks when you join sessions to meet others. It's hard for your fingers when you make sketchnotes two days long.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>When I released my website in January 2020, I was a hundred percent sure, that I wanted to add my sketchnotes in it as well... but I needed more time to think about how to implement it and I was also unsure about how the layout and navigation should look like.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>Is it really important to build mobile apps with accessibility features and who needs them? Deep down, everyone of us knows that when we don’t support accessibility features in our products, we leave users behind. But in reality, we all find tons of excuses for not going that extra mile …</p>
