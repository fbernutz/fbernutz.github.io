To be less freaked out when an interviewer asks me about capture lists or memory management in Swift, I wanted to make some sketchnotes on possible interview topics. I'm learning some of these topics anyway, so sketchnotes would be perfect as a summary (at least for me). And if they help me, maybe they'll help you too.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer 1:</strong> The list of topics isn't exhaustive. I have no idea what your interviewers will ask you about in your interviews.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer 2:</strong> There are much better and more detailed sources to learn about the details. These are just "small" summaries about the most important points <em>for me</em>. There might be other important points for you.</p><h2>Topics</h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m thinking of creating a small series of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sketchnotes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sketchnotes</a> that explains/summarizes some topics for iOS job interviews. <br><br>Currently, I have on my list:<br>- Swift Evolution<br>- Structs vs Classes<br>- Closures<br>- Generics<br>- Sets<br><br>In which topics would you be interested? ðŸ¤” <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ios?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ios</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iosdev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iosdev</a></p>&mdash; diehimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1369972198685949954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>On my list are currently the following topics:</p><ul><li>Swift Evolution (done âœ…)</li><li>Structs vs Classes</li><li>Sets</li><li>Concurrency / Dispatch Queues</li><li>Grand Central Dispatch / NSOperations</li><li>Protocol / Delegate Pattern</li><li>Notification / Observer</li><li>Closures</li><li>Generics</li><li>Core Graphics</li><li>Extensions</li><li>UIKit Constraints / AutoLayout</li><li>Storyboard vs layout-in-code</li><li>SwiftUI Data Flow</li></ul><p>I won't create sketchnotes for every topic, but I think it's good to have a list of relevant topics that you can study or prepare for your interviews.</p><p>Now, I'll walk you through the sketchnotes I have created as part of my preparation and add some additional links to them for your further studies. There will be more sketchnotes in the next days/weeks.</p><h2>Swift Evolution</h2><p><em>(added on 15th of March 2021)</em></p><p>Let's start with the evolution of Swift. I started working with iOS when Swift 2 was the latest release - it was in 2015.</p><p>Creating this sketchnote was especially fun because I could look back at the features which were added step by step. I had almost forgotten that there was a time when Swift had no <code>guard</code> statement or <code>try and catch</code>. I don't miss it ðŸ˜‰</p><a href="../../images/summaries-ios-interview-topics/swift-evolution.jpg" target="_blank">

</a><h3>Additional links</h3><ul><li>The History of Swift <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)#History">on Wikipedia</a></li><li>I can recommend all "What's new in Swift..." articles by <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws">Paul Hudson</a> where the most important changes for each Swift version are explained. You can find them on <a href="www.hackingwithswift.com">Hacking With Swift</a>.</li></ul><h2>Stay Tuned</h2><p>More sketchnotes will follow the next days!</p>
