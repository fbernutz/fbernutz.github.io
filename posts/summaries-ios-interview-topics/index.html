</figure><h2>Topics</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1369972198685949954?s=20">I asked on twitter for possible interview topics</a>. On my list are currently the following:</p><ul><li><a href="#swift-evolution">Swift Evolution</a> (done ✅)</li><li><a href="#structs-vs-classes">Structs vs Classes</a> (done ✅)</li><li><a href="#sets">Sets</a> (done ✅)</li><li><a href="#gcd">Grand Central Dispatch / Concurrency / OperationQueue</a> (done ✅)</li><li><a href="#generics">Generics</a> (done ✅)</li><li><a href="#autolayout">Auto Layout and Constraints</a> (done ✅)</li><li>Messaging Patterns (KVO / Delegate / Notification / Observer)</li><li>Closures</li><li>Core Graphics</li><li>Extensions</li><li>SwiftUI Data Flow</li><li>Memory Management with ARC</li></ul><p><em>Disclaimer: The list of topics isn't exhaustive. I have no idea what your interviewers will ask you about in your interviews. But this is an overview about the most common topics. (More iOS Interview Questions at <a href="https://github.com/raywenderlich/ios-interview/tree/master/iOS%20Specific%20Questions">GitHub by raywenderlich.com</a> or at <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/interview-questions">Hacking With Swift</a>)</em></p><p>Now, I'll walk you through the sketchnotes I have created as part of my preparation and add some additional links to them for your further studies. There will be more sketchnotes in the next days/weeks. But I won't have time to create sketchnotes for every single topic.</p><h2 id="swift-evolution">Swift Evolution</h2><p><em>(added on 15th of March 2021)</em></p><p>Let's start with the evolution of Swift. I started with iOS development shortly before the release of Swift 2 – it was in 2015.</p><p>Creating this sketchnote was especially fun because I could look back at the features which were added step by step. I had almost forgotten that there was a time when Swift had no <code>guard</code> statement or <code>try and catch</code>. I don't miss it 😉</p><a href="../../images/summaries-ios-interview-topics/swift-evolution.jpg" target="_blank">

You can find them on <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com">Hacking With Swift</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="structs-vs-classes">Structs vs Classes</h2><p><em>(added on 16th of March 2021)</em></p><p>"Structs vs Classes" is a real classic in interviews.</p><p>It was a bit difficult to focus on the most important things here. I have two more pages of notes about capture lists and memory management in Swift. Maybe I add both topics to the list and make own sketchnotes for them or I can combine the topics with another topic. Let's see.</p><p>So, this sketchnote contains (in my opinion) the most important differences between Structs and Classes in Swift, with some additional thoughts and a small chart about when (and why) to use an Enum, a Struct or a Class.</p><a href="../../images/summaries-ios-interview-topics/structs-vs-classes.jpg" target="_blank">

There's a lot going on in it, but I tried to make containers to group content and connect it with arrows when needed. It's just a huge topic, or rather it's a lot of topics that have to do with each other!</p><p>Do you know the difference between threads and queues? Well, to be honest, it wasn't clear to me before I made the sketchnote. So, I'm glad I learned something new!</p><a href="../../images/summaries-ios-interview-topics/gcd.jpg" target="_blank">

I think the "abstraction" might be one reason why I sometimes have trouble understanding generic code.
