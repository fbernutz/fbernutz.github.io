												<p class="release-date">May 16, 2019 ‚ãÖ 8 min read</p><h1 id=	"building-apps-for-everyone?!">Building Apps for Everyone?!</h1><p>Deep down, everyone of us knows that when we don‚Äôt support accessibility features in our products, we leave users behind. But in reality, we all find tons of excuses for not going that extra mile ‚Ä¶</p><p>When you add new features to your app, nobody will test accessibility features (I really hope there are some exceptions out there). You don‚Äôt even get the time and money to implement these features. So, at some point, you as a developer, simply don‚Äôt think about it anymore.</p><hr><h2 id=	"a-few-weeks-ago,-i-had-a-key-experience.">A few weeks ago, I had a key experience.</h2><p>My mom is visually and motor impaired and she got her <em>first</em> smartphone (Hallo Mama üëã). I never even imagined that this could be a thing for her, but one day, she just called a friend and went out to buy a used Android smartphone. She asked me for help to set everything up, install some apps, and explain some things here and there.</p><p>I observed closely how she interacted with her new phone. It was nearly impossible for her to type in her personal information to create a Google account, because her fine motor skills were too weak. The difficulties she had using the smartphone really blew my mind.</p><p>The first thing we did, was to scale up the system font size, and we realized that even the Android system itself is not fully optimized for accessibility.</p><figure>
    <img  src="../../images/building-apps-for-everyone/example.jpg"  alt="Screenshot of an Android Smartphone where the font size is enlarged and half of the text is not readable because it's trimmed">
    <figcaption>Screenshot of an Android Smartphone where the font size is enlarged and half of the text is not readable because it's trimmed</figcaption>
</figure><p>One might think that increasing the system font size that much is a rare use case. And some people might even say, that this would only be relevant for less than about 5% of their product‚Äôs target group. It would not be worth the money to build something only for these few people, so they can be ignored! Right?</p><p>Ehh‚Ä¶ No.</p><h2 id=	"who-actually-needs-accessibility-features?">Who actually needs accessibility features?</h2><p>First, everybody thinks of <strong>permanently</strong> disabled people, like people with only one arm, and blind or deaf people.</p><p>But there are also <strong>temporarily</strong> disabled people, like someone who has a broken arm and can only use one hand to operate a smartphone.</p><p>People move in different environments. So, there are also <strong>situational</strong> disabilities. When you are a new parent, you carry your baby on your arm all the time. Therefore you suddenly just have one hand to use your smartphone. Abilities can change dramatically, depending on the environment you are in.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúAccessibility is not just about making information available to users with disabilities ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making information available to everyone, regardless of their capabilities or situation.‚Äù ‚Äî Apple</p></blockquote><figure>

</figure><h2 id=	"which-tools-does-apple-offer-to-help?">Which tools does Apple offer to help?</h2><p>Apple is really good in supporting users with accessibility features. But Android is also not that bad with Google Assistant (and all the features, like Live Caption, Live Relay, and Live Transcribe they have recently announced at Google I/O). As I am an iOS developer, I will only focus on some features which are available on iOS.</p><h3 id=	"voice-over">Voice Over</h3><blockquote><p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to see your iPhone to use your iPhone.‚Äù ‚Äî Apple</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/de/accessibility/iphone/vision/">Voice Over</a> is a gesture-based screen reader. You can navigate through elements on the screen by swiping to the right to focus the next element.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Voice Over reads content aloud, like ‚ÄúThe Hustle, 6.5 of 10, released on May 10, 2019‚Äù.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Normally, the position and the spacing between elements like text and images connects the content, but users with vision loss can‚Äôt see this. The <strong>content should be bundled semantically</strong>, so it‚Äôs read aloud together and will be focused as one element.</p><h3 id=	"reading-support">Reading Support</h3><blockquote><p>‚ÄúYou see it. iPhone says it.‚Äù ‚Äî Apple</p></blockquote><p>Turn on <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/learning/">Speak Screen</a> and swipe down from the top of the screen with two fingers, or just tell Siri to Speak Screen, to have all the content on pages read back to you.</p><p>You can also select text to be read aloud for you with a ‚ÄúSpeak‚Äù button. This is extremely useful for people who find it easier to listen to a voice rather than read a text.</p><figure>
    <img src="../../images/building-apps-for-everyone/speak.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the popover which appears when you select text and where you can activate "Speak" to read out aloud the selected text." />
    <figcaption>With Reading Support, text can be read aloud for you.</figcaption>
</figure><h3 id=	"dynamic-type">Dynamic Type</h3><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/">Dynamic Type</a> converts the text size to a larger (or smaller) size. It‚Äôs a systemwide setting, so every third-party app should support it.</p><figure style="max-width: 548px">

</figure><p>These are some statistics about which font size users of PDF Viewer Pro use. It‚Äôs interesting to see how many people don‚Äôt use the default system font size (L) in iOS ‚Äî nearly <strong>one quarter</strong>.</p><p>While these statistics can be a good validation whether to support dynamic type or not, it should be supported because it‚Äôs simply <strong>the right thing</strong> to do.</p><figure style="max-width: 548px">

So, let‚Äôs remind ourselves about that in our daily work. Test your app with accessibility features enabled and tell your development team about issues. Your users will be grateful.</p><hr><blockquote><p>‚ÄúIf we use our own abilities as a baseline, we make things that are easy for some people to use, but difficult for everyone else.‚Äù ‚Äî Microsoft</p></blockquote><figure>

</figure><hr><h3 id=	"about-this-post">About this post</h3><p><em>Two weeks ago, I gave a presentation about this topic at our client‚Äôs workspace with the goal to change the mindset about who needs an app that supports accessibility features, and how important it is to build an app for everyone. The main target group of this talk was people from our business and lead team. I received great feedback. Some of the attendees didn‚Äôt even know about these features and they found it really important to learn about this topic. So, I put my words into this blog post to reach one or two more people (and to remember the points I was talking about).</em></p><p><em>You can find my slides from the talk here: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/fbernutz/building-apps-for-everyone">https://speakerdeck.com/fbernutz/building-apps-for-everyone</a></em></p><h3 id=	"additional-links">Additional Links</h3><p><em>The following resources were used for the quotes in this blog post and are a good starting point to get more information about Accessibility and Inclusive Design.
