    <figcaption>Before and after activating the Spelling and Grammar setting.</figcaption>
</figure><h2>How to activate the setting</h2><ul><li>Open Xcode</li><li>Have your cursor in a file with text (otherwise you canâ€™t activate the setting and it will be greyed out)</li><li>Activate the setting in Xcodeâ€™s system menu with: <code>Edit &gt; Format &gt; Spelling and Grammar &gt; Check Spelling While Typing</code></li></ul><figure>

    <figcaption>The path to the setting in Xcode.</figcaption>
</figure><h2>ðŸ¥³ Benefits</h2><ul><li>This is not limited to comments and <strong>will also work in variable/function/type names</strong>, even in camelCase syntax.</li><li>Itâ€™s especially <strong>useful if your hardware keyboard has some issues</strong> and keys are stuck while typing and you get repetitive characters without recognizing it.</li><li>It even works with multiple languages if the setting for it is activated (check it in <code>Preferences &gt; Spelling</code>).</li><li>You and your colleagues donâ€™t have to make others aware of typos anymore.</li><li>If you use some idioms or specific words in your company, which are spelled correctly, but Xcode is complaining about them, you can let the <strong>system learn a word</strong>, so youâ€™re not seeing the red underline anymore.</li></ul><h2>See Video</h2><figure>
