Yay! 🥳</p><figure>

</figure><p>Besides being quite nervous obviously, I had a great experience on stage! I think... Because I don’t really remember anything except going on stage and leaving the stage again 😅</p><p>At the conference, I had some initial hesitance to approach other people, because I’m very introverted and everyone spoke in French and I didn’t want to force anyone to speak English with me. But I met some of the nicest people who saw me standing around by myself and who decided to talk to me and include me in their group 🧡 I did not expect something like this!</p><p>In general, I was very impressed with the inclusivity of the event. It was amazing to meet new people outside of my iOS developer bubble and I really enjoyed the events that were organized for the speakers, which helped me a lot to connect with others. Sadly there were only a few other talks in English, the rest were given in French. But from talking to other speakers, I heard that there were a lot of interesting talks about more inclusion in workplaces and about accessibility. Maybe there’s a chance to watch the recordings with English transcripts 🤞</p><p>Lyon alone is worth the trip. I really enjoyed walking around and exploring the city. There are some beautiful areas with fascinating views! After the conference, we had the opportunity to join a two-hour city tour to learn more about the history of Lyon.</p><p>Thank you to all MiXiT organizers and participants for making this a lovely experience!</p><figure>

    <img src="../../images/2023-04-18-mixit-talk/sketchnote.jpg" alt="Sketchnote from talk by Feli Bernutz: My story, I’ve never dreamed to work in IT but wanted to work with art / design. Job as iOS Developer. Am I at the right place? Don’t change to fit in! Inclusion is having a voice. Tips for inclusive environment: 1. Introduce yourself with your pronouns. 2. Make everyone’s voice heard. 3. Don’t act surprised when someone doesn’t know what you say, use it as opportunity. Embrace diversity: give feedback, talk about income, developer job is diverse, fight imposter syndrome, find community" />
