														</h1>
														<p>It's been a year now since I started learning to swim freestyle. At that time I couldn't even do two strokes before I started having panic attacks and needed a break to breathe.</p>

																<a href="/posts/2021-08-22-well-being">How I take care of my well being... or at least try to</a>
														</h1>
														<p>About ten months ago, I started to feel unmotivated, stressed and annoyed very often. I quickly became emotional and thought about little things until late at night. I couldn’t concentrate and was restless and driveless. At this point, I had been working from home for six months and felt like I could never switch off from work and every day felt like the other (thanks to social distancing and lockdowns). I realised I wasn’t doing well and thought about how I could improve my work-life balance and set more boundaries to force myself to focus on things other than work again. I tried to remind myself that work isn’t the only thing that defines my worth.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>After my first technical interviews in years, I have found that it's always a good idea to refresh your knowledge and prepare for technical interview questions (who would've thought) 😅 Although I knew what the questions were about, I found it difficult to talk about details and explain topics spontaneously. To be less freaked out when an interviewer asks me about capture lists or memory management in Swift, I wanted to make some sketchnotes on possible interview topics. They would be perfect as a summary. And if they help me, maybe they'll help you too.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>I have a confession to make. It's really sad, but true. In my career as an iOS developer, I've only ever build iPhone apps. iPads were never meant to be supported. Well... the apps "worked" in theory! Sort of. So, during my vacation in December, it was finally time to start working on the two-plus years old ticket to add iPad and iPhone landscape support for Cineaste App.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>One year ago, I wrote down the most important things for me from 2019. I really liked it, because it helped me to process the year and to remember what happened. Obviously, 2020 is marked by the pandemic. I wish so badly that this will be over soon! A few days ago, I watched "Soul" and it reminded me not to wait for something but to enjoy the little things. So, I need to write this down to remember myself that not everything was bad and that I've learned and experienced a lot.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>Since 2018, I make sketchnotes of conference talks and lots of other things. I've always used pen and paper for it. As an iOS developer, I spend much of my time on my MacBook and my iPhone and somehow I wanted to hide from all the digital stuff. I also love to have one book with all sketchnotes, and to be able to browse through the book and remember everything easily.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>I love visiting conferences! But two days full of conference talks are hard! It's hard for your brain to stay focused and to process the things you've heard. It's hard for your back when you sit on your chair all the time, not only during the talks but also during the little breaks when you join sessions to meet others. It's hard for your fingers when you make sketchnotes two days long.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>When I released my website in January 2020, I was a hundred percent sure, that I wanted to add my sketchnotes in it as well... but I needed more time to think about how to implement it and I was also unsure about how the layout and navigation should look like.</p>

														</h1>
														<p>Is it really important to build mobile apps with accessibility features and who needs them? Deep down, everyone of us knows that when we don’t support accessibility features in our products, we leave users behind. But in reality, we all find tons of excuses for not going that extra mile …</p>
