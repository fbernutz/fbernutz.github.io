At that time I couldn’t even do two strokes before I started having panic attacks and needed a break to breathe. I started a four-week swimming course and by the end of the course I could swim a 25-metres lane, which was an incredible achievement for me (see <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1322298203841155072?s=20">tweet</a>).</p><p>Then, the second COVID wave hit Germany hard and all the swimming pools were closed for almost half a year.</p><p>When I was able to go swimming again this summer, it felt almost like it did when I first started. I definitely couldn’t swim 25 metres anymore (and in the outdoor pool I even had a longer 50-metres lane). It took me many hours of watching tutorials on proper technique and trying again and again and again until I could finally see small progress after some weeks! And somehow I finally could crawl a 50-metres lane! That was an incredible feeling! It actually motivated me so much that I didn’t want to do anything else but swim all day 😅</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Looking quite professional 😏</figcaption>
</figure><p>Now that the outdoor pool season is over again, I went swimming yesterday for the first time in a year in the same indoor pool where I also had my swimming class last year. And you know what? The shorter 25-metres lane helps me so much to just get a liiiiittle break to breathe, so I almost crawled ONE kilometer in half an hour!</p><img src="../../images/2021-09-25-one-year-swimming/freestyle.jpg" alt="Screenshot of swimming workout with 225m breaststroke and 925m freestyle." /><p>Definitely the best feeling ever! #NeverGiveUp</p><p>I can’t wait to go swimming again!</p>
