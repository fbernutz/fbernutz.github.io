																		<a href="/posts/2021-08-22-well-being">How I take care of my well being... or at least try to</a>
																</h1>
																<p>About ten months ago, I started to feel unmotivated, stressed and annoyed very often. I quickly became emotional and thought about little things until late at night. I couldnâ€™t concentrate and was restless and driveless. At this point, I had been working from home for six months and felt like I could never switch off from work and every day felt like the other (thanks to social distancing and lockdowns). I realised I wasnâ€™t doing well and thought about how I could improve my work-life balance and set more boundaries to force myself to focus on things other than work again. I tried to remind myself that work isnâ€™t the only thing that defines my worth.</p>

																		<a href="/posts/summaries-ios-interview-topics">Sketchnote Summaries of possible iOS Interview Topics</a>
																</h1>
																<p>After my first technical interviews in years, I have found that it's always a good idea to refresh your knowledge and prepare for technical interview questions (who would've thought) ðŸ˜… Although I knew what the questions were about, I found it difficult to talk about details and explain topics spontaneously. To be less freaked out when an interviewer asks me about capture lists or memory management in Swift, I wanted to make some sketchnotes on possible interview topics. They would be perfect as a summary. And if they help me, maybe they'll help you too.</p>

																		<a href="/posts/basic-ipad-support">How I Added Basic iPad Support to my iPhone Only App</a>
																</h1>
																<p>I have a confession to make. It's really sad, but true. In my career as an iOS developer, I've only ever build iPhone apps. iPads were never meant to be supported. Well... the apps "worked" in theory! Sort of. So, during my vacation in December, it was finally time to start working on the two-plus years old ticket to add iPad and iPhone landscape support for Cineaste App.</p>
