																		<a href="/posts/summaries-ios-interview-topics">Summaries of (some possible) iOS Interview Topics</a>
																</h1>
																<p>After a few technical interviews, I realised that it's good to prepare for them (who would've thought) ðŸ˜… Although I knew what the questions were about, I found it difficult to talk about details and explain some topics spontaneously. To be less freaked out when an interviewer asks me about capture lists or memory management in Swift, I wanted to make some sketchnotes on possible interview topics. I'm learning some of these topics anyway, so sketchnotes would be perfect as a summary (at least for me). And if they help me, maybe they'll help you too.</p>

																		<a href="/posts/basic-ipad-support">How I Added Basic iPad Support to my iPhone Only App</a>
																</h1>
																<p>I have a confession to make. It's really sad, but true. In my career as an iOS developer, I've only ever build iPhone apps. iPads were never meant to be supported. Well... the apps "worked" in theory! Sort of. So, during my vacation in December, it was finally time to start working on the two-plus years old ticket to add iPad and iPhone landscape support for Cineaste App.</p>

																		<a href="/posts/thoughts-about-2020">Thoughts about 2020</a>
																</h1>
																<p>One year ago, I wrote down the most important things for me from 2019. I really liked it, because it helped me to process the year and to remember what happened. Obviously, 2020 is marked by the pandemic. I wish so badly that this will be over soon! A few days ago, I watched "Soul" and it reminded me not to wait for something but to enjoy the little things. So, I need to write this down to remember myself that not everything was bad and that I've learned and experienced a lot.</p>
