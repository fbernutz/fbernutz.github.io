																<p>It's been a year now since I started learning to swim freestyle. At that time I couldn't even do two strokes before I started having panic attacks and needed a break to breathe.</p>

																		<a href="/posts/2021-08-22-well-being">How I take care of my well being... or at least try to</a>
																</h1>
																<p>About ten months ago, I started to feel unmotivated, stressed and annoyed very often. I quickly became emotional and thought about little things until late at night. I couldnâ€™t concentrate and was restless and driveless. At this point, I had been working from home for six months and felt like I could never switch off from work and every day felt like the other (thanks to social distancing and lockdowns). I realised I wasnâ€™t doing well and thought about how I could improve my work-life balance and set more boundaries to force myself to focus on things other than work again. I tried to remind myself that work isnâ€™t the only thing that defines my worth.</p>

																		<a href="/posts/summaries-ios-interview-topics">Sketchnote Summaries of possible iOS Interview Topics</a>
																</h1>
																<p>After my first technical interviews in years, I have found that it's always a good idea to refresh your knowledge and prepare for technical interview questions (who would've thought) ðŸ˜… Although I knew what the questions were about, I found it difficult to talk about details and explain topics spontaneously. To be less freaked out when an interviewer asks me about capture lists or memory management in Swift, I wanted to make some sketchnotes on possible interview topics. They would be perfect as a summary. And if they help me, maybe they'll help you too.</p>
